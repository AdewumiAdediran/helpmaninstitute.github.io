    "text": "There is currently limited evidence, if any, to support the hysteria that emerged out of the first decade of the 21st century, of the prospective dividends of Africa’s growing population, and especially of the youth cohorts. The Africa rising meme has since mellowed as a result of weakening economic growth, due primarily to falling commodity prices, and softening growth prospects.\nEconomic growth in the continent fell from average of 5.4% in 2000-2010 to 3.3% in 2010-2015 compared to global growth of 3.0% and 2.9% during the corresponding periods. The downward trend continued as growth in the region dropped further to 2.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, as population growth slowed in the rest of the world, Africa has continued to experience population boom. Projections indicate that Africa will account for about 60% of global population growth between 2017 and 2050 and be the main contributor to global population thereafter.\nNigeria maintains an outsize influence on the African population and economic growth trajectory. As shown below, the decline in Africa’s economic growth from 3.9% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2016 reflects largely the decline in performance of the Nigeria economy from 5.5% growth in 2013 to 1.5% contraction in 2016. The influence is also noticeable in the projections through 2018 (Figure 1.1).\n\nWith population of 187 million in 2017, Nigeria is currently the 7th most populous country and home to the fastest growing population in the world (2.7% per annum during 2010-2015). As a result, while Africa is recognized to have the youngest population among the world regions, Nigeria’s population is even younger. Children under age 15 account for 44% of Nigeria’s population compared to 41% in Africa, while the share of youths aged 15-19 remains the same at 19%. While a youthful population portends opportunities for demographic dividends, young children create additional burden of economic dependency that constrains potential dividends.\nThe economic benefits of population are dependent primarily on labor markets than any other market. That is, whether a growing population of working age becomes a net benefit or net burden depends primarily on the vibrancy of industry and commerce, and whether the labor force possesses the skills and human capital requirements of the sector.\nIn the absence of social safety nets, more specifically unemployment benefit programs, self-employment and entrepreneurship becomes the viable option for labor force participants unable to secure paid employment in government and organized private sector. Thus, in the absence of productive and competitive education and skills, hard and soft infrastructure essential for channeling financial resources to prospective entrepreneurs, and a friendly entrepreneurship sector, a growing population is essentially a ticking time bomb.\nAlthough evidence shows that Nigeria is already within the demographic window of opportunity, a period during which population can yield substantial economic benefits if the conditions are right, there is no evidence that the country will generate positive demographic dividends under current conditions and the population and development experience.\nThe question on the minds of observers and analysts is how Nigeria can turn its growing population into a force for accelerated growth and development. Among other things, this will require changes in population structure and its geography, growth and productivity. The alternative is to maintain the status quo and look on as the population turns into an economic burden and breeding ground for social unrest, and ultimately a disaster."

    "text": "Company managers and national policy-makers have always considered productivity as central to growth and competitiveness. In the past, companies simply accumulated factor inputs (employed more land, labor and capital) and expanded operations. The trick for achieving growth is that additional input of a factor raises the partial (marginal) productivity of the other factors. Thus, abundant labor combined with natural resources including arable land, forests and underground deposits that could be sold to acquire the needed materials and machines, were the engines of growth. Economic competitiveness policies focused on comparative advantage in factors of production, and countries are encouraged to exploit the factors they have in abundance. However, models explaining economic change in late 20th century began to speculate the emergence of technological innovation and imitation as foremost drivers of growth and evolution of industrial structure. To be successful over a long period of time, it is simply not enough to employ more; firms and economies must develop the ability to innovate and employ new technologies derived from innovations.1 Rather than factor accumulation, economic growth was driven primarily by shifts or changes in production functions. Thus, economic competitiveness policies shifted emphasis from comparative advantage driven by factor endowments to deliberate pursuit of strategic competitive advantage driven by high value addition and economies of scale.\nIn the globalized world of the 21st century, innovation has become mandatory for survival, competitiveness and growth of individuals, firms, regions and countries. Anyone of these units is easily blown out of its respective competition once innovation slows or ceases, ranging from individuals competing in labor markets, firms competing in product markets, states or regions competing for investments, and countries competing in export markets. Competitiveness of these units in output markets determine their respective abilities to compete in the input markets, further elevating the centrality of innovation to market development and competition. In the social or nonmarket economy, innovation can make a difference in how a state manages diversity and prevents conflict, educates its population, provides access to safe drinking water, eradicates disease and reduces hunger. The value created by innovation manifests in new ways of doing things and emergence of new products and processes that contribute to increasing the level of society’s well-being. Innovation transforms inner capabilities of individuals, firms, societies and economies, and strengthens their capabilities to learn, adopt and exploit new ideas.\nThere are many definitions of innovation as are analysts of the subject. However, a more general definition that captures the main essence considers innovation as “the search for, and the discovery, experimentation, development, imitation, and adoption of new products, new production processes and new organizational set-ups.”2 Other definitions associate innovation with application of ideas, knowledge or practices that are new to particular contexts with the purpose of creating positive changes or seizing opportunities. Noticeably, the definitions stress the words “new”, “change” and “improve” in defining innovation. Thus, for any process, product or service to be considered as innovation, the novelty, useful changes and improvements should be noticeable, meaning, a large improvement or bits of changes that accumulate to produce a significant improvement.\nMore than anything else, the quantity and quality of innovation strongly depend on the depth of the “knowledge economy,” a term which describes the production and application of knowledge to create new processes, products and markets.3 The core of this economy comprises research universities and colleges, institutional and corporate research and development laboratories and programs that produce knowledge, as well as education and training systems that utilize new knowledge to produce more capable workforce, which in turn raises the quality of knowledge produced. This symbiotic core is bolstered by institutions and regulations that protect intellectual property rights and create strong incentives for knowledge production; information and communication technology and other infrastructure that facilitate exchange and reduce the cost of access to frontier knowledge and products; vibrant competitive markets for capital needed for entrepreneurship and commercialization of new knowledge; and a business sector that absorbs knowledge, grows in depth and sophistication, and provides feedback to the core. Together, these factors constitute the pillars of innovation input in the Global Innovation Index (GII)4, co-published annually by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Innovation output is measured by scientific publications and patents; medium and high-technology component of manufactures, technical component of exports and share of the creative industry in the economy.\nThe knowledge production and absorption system, funded and supported by private companies and governments, constitutes the core, central and indispensable pillar of the innovation economy. Outputs generated in this system are disseminated through books and articles in scientific journals, translated into patent applications and other scientifically codified products, and are absorbed into the education and workforce development systems that in effect create more knowledgeable workforce. However, an efficiently-managed well-developed statistical system that supports regular and extensive data collection is indispensable for the knowledge economy. Countries that invest in planning and data collection encourage and attract the best of knowledge development skills; they maintain higher quality and standard of education and better quality of human capital, produce more scientific outputs, and have greater success at innovation.\nThe second pillar of the innovation economy are the institutions that engender social stability, protect intellectual property rights and create strong incentives for investment and trade in innovation output. First, a system that insulates the knowledge economy from political instability is essential. University faculty strikes and industrial actions, in response to political stimulus, that affect research and training institutions constitute an albatross to development. In addition to institutional arrangements that encourage application for patents, a sound legal system that protects copyrights and guarantees individual rights to knowledge output, supported by regulations that are favorable to business startups, is essential for development of market and growth of innovations. Academic researchers, writers and composers are often afraid to share their original ideas with colleagues for comments and scientific scrutiny for fear of plagiarism, unapproved imitation and piracy due to lack of strong protection by the legal system. This apprehension limits the extent of collaborations and thus the quality of outputs. Research articles produced in such systems often end up in departmental journals that are not read outside of the department and similar journals that are not widely read and cited. In the end they become knowledge that society cannot use.\nA culture of experimentation and entrepreneurship is key to innovation. Meanwhile, capital is essential for transforming ideas into products particularly for innovators who are not endowed with family wealth or other forms of startup funding. While programs to stimulate entrepreneurial culture are essential, vibrant markets for entrepreneurship capital that are accessible to the young and talented are essential, particularly initiatives that do not require collaterals such as business plan competitions. Deepening the market for small business capital, startups and venture capital will also require credit and information systems that the financial services industry can build upon.\nA business economy that is based on educated, knowledgeable and high skill workforce, and provides regular feedbacks to the knowledge production and education sectors are essential to aligning the knowledge and business economies. This requires regular engagement and collaboration between industry, academia and policymakers.\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) and other infrastructure that facilitate knowledge codification and packaging, and reduce the cost of production and access to frontier knowledge and outputs constitute the next pillar of the innovation economy. Access to internet and mobile communications technology, efficient logistics in terms of transportation infrastructure, solar and electric energy infrastructure to power productive activities, all contribute to efficient production and exchange of goods and services derived from new ideas. Information systems are also crucial for reduction of asymmetry between actors in the innovation economy. Systems that enable the shifting of resources toward the most productive use of them are essential for efficiency. Students making decisions about what course of academic study to pursue require accurate and timely information about what kinds of jobs the economy is producing and where the jobs will be coming from by the time they complete their education, thus helping to avert mismatches between the skills being acquired and those needed, thus avoiding loss of economic value through creation of human capital that businesses cannot use.\nAmong the former British colonies that were endowed with initial potential, India offers a leading example of knowledge-driven development. At independence in 1947, the economy was dominantly agrarian with a population of 345 million that was the second largest in the world. By 1950, agriculture accounted for 60 percent of the economy while industry and services were 12 percent and 28 percent respectively, and the non-agricultural sector was dominantly informal.  However, the country’s economic development and transformation had been quicker than the developed world and more balanced than China’s, despite a larger share of microenterprises that minimized opportunities for economies of scale. Since 1965, India’s GDP growth rate has risen on a decadal basis and is currently among the highest in the world. By 2014, the share of agriculture declined to 14 percent as industry and services grew to 28 percent and 58 percent respectively. Often regarded as the largest democracy in the world, India was ranked by Forbes as the best emerging market in 2014, numbers among the current top destinations for medical tourism, and has 3 of its leading companies ranked among the top 100 innovative companies in 2015. These include a consumer good company ranked 41st, its largest information technology company ranked 64th and its largest pharmaceutical company ranked in the 71st position.\nThis performance is by no small measure driven by a strong knowledge economy which began to develop prior to independence. Growing out of a statistical laboratory that dates back to the 1920s, the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was founded in 1931 as “a learned society,” led by an Indian national, with the objective to carry out research, teaching, training and development projects in all sectors of the economy. The institute became integrated into the Indian statistical system, which had been in existence since 1862, through its pioneering engagement in agricultural experiments, large-scale surveys, statistical quality control and national development planning. After gaining independence in 1947, the government demonstrated its commitment to the knowledge economy through an Act of Parliament declaring the ISI as an Institute of National Importance in 1959 and granting the right to award degrees and diplomas in statistics. After satisfying the personnel requirements of the national, state and district statistics departments, trained statisticians spilled over into quality control and improvement jobs in industry, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Due to this head-start over other developing regions in data and statistics, India became the foremost attraction to academic researchers from the developed world interested in less developed societies, and consequently, provided the primary context for the formative period of development economics research.\nAlthough the green revolution originated in Mexico in the 1940s, its adoption and greatest success around the world took place in India beginning in mid-1960s, aided by an existing system of experimentation and research that grew out of the ISI. Further technical advances in agriculture enabled a structural transition in which the share of agriculture in total employment declined commensurately with its share of value addition. The benefits for poverty reduction were evident. Although India is home to the largest number of poor people than any country in the world, estimated at 273 million in 2012, its poverty incidence dropped from 56.4 percent in 1973 to 21.9 percent  in 2012, a rate that was considered one of the lowest among countries with the largest number of poor people. The informal share of the economy dropped from 40 percent in 1950 to 20 percent in 20085.\nIn contrast, Nigeria offers example of a former British colony endowed with similar potential for knowledge-driven development but instead pursued a path of “dependent” development. At the time of independence in 1960, agriculture accounted for 64 percent of the Nigerian economy while industry and services were 10 percent and 26 percent respectively. By 2014, agriculture was down to 22 percent of the economy, with industry and services accounting for 25 percent and 53 percent respectively. However, the transition was anything but balanced; poverty rates increased from less than 30 percent in the 1970s to 69 percent in 2012 and is estimated, after methodological revisions, to be 33 percent in 2013; the informal share of the economy decreased from 63 percent in 1970 to 50 percent in 2008.\nEfforts to establish a statistical system began6 in 1928 when the British Colonial government established a statistics unit in the office of the Colonial Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat. In 1947, a statistics section was created in the Customs and Excise Department which was afterward transformed into a full-fledged Department of Statistics. The Department of Statistics was subsequently expanded to form the nucleus of a central national statistics office. The Statistics Act of 1957 provided for a decentralized statistical system and collaboration between the central and regional statistical offices. At independence in 1960, the Department was moved from Customs and Excise to the Federal Ministry of Economic Development and was renamed the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS). In the post-independence period, the statistical system was underfunded, under-appreciated and was not taken as a serious source of information essential for national development. Subsequent changes to the system including the shifting of responsibility for financial statistics to the Central Bank and demographic and health statistics to the Nigerian Population Commission, and the abolishing of the common statistical system in the 1980s and served to weaken the statistical system and render it irrelevant. In spite of reforms and restructuring leading to creation of the National Bureau of Statistics in 2007, the current statistical system remains weak and underfunded; most of the recent development surveys are funded from external sources, and regular surveys conducted by them have little depth and usefulness.\nThe lackluster attitude toward domestic statistical system and the knowledge creation it facilitates is a reflection of the culture of “knowledge dependence” that pervaded the mindset of government and policymakers. The idea, which dominated the African independence era of the 1960s and has had lingering effects thereafter, was that the stock of scientific knowledge required for economic progress existed in the developed countries and simply needed to be transmitted to the developing countries in order for them to develop.To be fair, this attitude was not deliberate, but was more essentially the outcome of two factors: a blind attachment to the prevailing paradigm and a mindset that believed in “free lunch!” On the first factor, African leaders bought wholesomely into the prevailing United Nations scientific agenda, which was driven by a “Good Samaritan” motive of facilitating application of science and technology in the less developed countries. The efforts began with the New York scientific conference on the conservation and utilization of resources in 1949, only 4 years after the creation of United Nations in 1945, and continued through the Geneva conference on the application of science and technology for the benefit of the less developed areas in 1963, as well as the Vienna conference on science and technology for development in 1979. On the second, African leaders tended to treat technology as manna from the developed world!. Instead of experimentation and research in agriculture, for example, it was believed that only extension agents were needed to persuade farmers to adopt better technologies that were available elsewhere. Thus, technical advancement in agriculture was pursued simply by expanding agricultural extension workforce. To this end, African countries hired additional 36,000 extension agents between 1959 and 1980.7 This attitude almost systematically neglected the importance of building-up of local capacity and ownership of productive and applicable knowledge.\nThe consequences of this neglect are dire at many levels. First, due to the symbiotic relationship between the education system on one hand, and research and experimentation system on the other hand, the quality of the former cannot be superior to the latter. Knowledge produced through research and development translates into capacity development through institutions of learning and intellectual development, and higher capacity reinforces the quality and outputs of research and development. The number of Nigerian universities increased from 5 in the immediate post-independence era in 1962, to 51 in 2005 and more rapidly to 129 in 2014 as a result of licensing of private universities.8 As at 2012,9 there were 37,504 academic staff in the public university system, and teaching staff to student ratio was on average 1:3310 but reached as high as 1:122 at the University of Abuja. Annual academic publications were 0.2 per capita, 83 percent of which were published in journals created by the teaching department of the author or in local journals that have no visibility, while the remainder appeared in international journals, majority of which are pay-to-publish outlets that rarely rank among those frequently consulted by policymakers and development partners. Public and university-level research grants are rare, and when are available, they are paltry sums that barely cover basic research costs. Over the years, the neglect of data and research has weakened the quality of university graduates. Research projects typically required for undergraduate degrees are increasingly written by online consultants and academic supervisors (in exchange for fees) or copied verbatim from existing research. Employers of labor increasingly require graduates to sit for qualifying examinations and, increasingly, are forced to retrain new recruits in order to bring them to the level of knowledge they ought to have attained in the university. Companies that find those efforts costly simply refuse to hire new graduates; most advertisements for jobs that fresh graduates were hired to do in the past now emphasizing years of work experience, leaving most graduates unemployable. The global ranking of top universities and colleges reflects this condition. While an Indian educational institution was ranked in the 251-300 range, the foremost and premier Nigerian university barely made it into list of the top 800 universities and colleges in 2015, ranking the in the 601-800 position.\nData from the Global Competitiveness Index (GII) presented in Table 1 also provides empirical support to the divergence in knowledge-driven development between the two countries. In assessing competitiveness of the education and training system, India was ranked in 45th position out of 144 countries on “quality of education system”, a sharp distinction from Nigeria’s rank of 122nd on the same index. Knowledge produced elsewhere is valuable only to the extent of available capacity to comprehend, adapt and apply them sensibly in the domestic context. While the research and experimentation system that had been well developed in India prior to the green revolution enabled understanding, adaptation and application of the high-yielding varieties that emerged, Nigeria and other African countries missed the opportunity to benefit from the movement due principally to lack of requisite capacity. India and Nigeria are wide apart in terms of the culture of research and experimentation, and consequently the culture of innovation, whether measured by company spending on R&D (India 30; Nigeria 106), availability of scientists and engineers (India 45; Nigeria 89), or university-industry collaborative R&D (India 50; Nigeria 123). On all these counts, India consistently ranked among the top 50 countries while Nigeria consistently ranked in the bottom half (below average) among the 144 countries.\nThe quality of knowledge systems affects not only the education system, but also the efficiency of health and economy-wide production systems and labor markets, thus affecting the capacity of the economy to attract and retain talents. On the basis of capacity to retain talents, India ranked 42nd while Nigeria ranked in 92nd position in the GCI. This is even so despite the more competitive ranking of the Nigerian labor market on account of freedom to hire and fire (Nigeria 7; India 47) and more minimal effect of taxation on labor supply (Nigeria 21; India 45). While both countries are large in population and provide large markets for entrepreneurs, the more competitive aspects of the Nigerian labor market do not seem enough for talent retention in the absence of a strong health system, high quality education system, vibrant enterprise capital market and a sound legal system for businesses, to mention a few. The positions of India and Nigeria are also distinct in terms of governance and institutions that support the knowledge economy. India ranks in the top 50 on account of judicial independence, efficiency of legal system, and efficiency of government spending. On the same indices, Nigeria’s position was clearly near the bottom, and in particular, ranked as one of the most wasteful spenders around the world (134/144). India is well positioned among the most developed enterprise capital market in the world, ranking in the top 30 in both venture capital market development and access to business loans. Again, Nigeria ranked in the bottom 30 on those indices. The divergent rankings in business sophistication also signal differences in the strategies pursued by the two countries. While India is evidently achieving competitive advantage through value chain deepening and business cluster development, Nigeria seems to remain firmly in the comparative advantage regime.\nGlobal Competitiveness Index 2014-2015FactorIndicatorsIndiaNigeriaAggregate Index71127Higher education and trainingQuality of the education system45122InnovationCompany spending on R&D30106Availability of scientists and engineers4589University-industry collaboration R&D50123Labor market efficiencyCapacity to retain talent4292Effect of taxation on incentive to work4521Hiring and firing practices477InstitutionsJudicial independence50102Wastefulness of government spending49134Efficiency of legal framework43105Financial Market DevelopmentAvailability of venture capital20131Ease of access to loans29137Business sophisticationBusiness cluster development2772Value chain breadth4392Competitive advantage44117\nIn spite of the lagging performance of Nigeria in this context, opportunity exists for catching up. However, Nigeria will not move to the frontier by simply importing technology. Neither will it catch up by simply harping on science and technology, a pattern that has a history of its own. What is required is to reverse the neglect through a set of well-targeted reforms, policies and programs that are focused on the knowledge economy.\nThe starting point is a wake-up call to the university system. An inspection of the mission statements of prominent Nigerian universities shows the centrality of innovation, high quality education, and needs of society to their existence. This is captured with statement such as “expand the frontiers of knowledge … produce graduates who are worthy in character and sound judgment … contribute to the transformation of society through creativity and innovation” (University of Ibadan);  “research and development, innovation, knowledge transfer and human resource development, … responsive to the needs of the society” (University of Nigeria, Nsukka); “new ideas and intellectual practices relevant to the needs of its immediate community, … advance the frontiers of learning, …. through teaching, research and the dissemination of knowledge of the highest quality.., to produce high-level human power and enhance capacity-building..” (Ahmadu Bello University Zaria); “application of modern technology to teaching, research and community service, and its provision of practical solutions to social, cultural and economic problems, … advancement of knowledge and its practical application to social, cultural, economic, scientific and technological problems” (Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife). However, the wake-up call will fall on deaf ears unless three critical challenges confronting the university system are taken seriously and addressed with a sense of urgency that they deserve. These are governance, standards and funding in decreasing order of importance and degree of urgency. Reversing or altering the order amounts to placing the cart before the horse!\nGovernance is the most important challenge. As the primary foundation of the knowledge economy, the university system requires self-regulation that is only sustainable through self-governance and stability that is realizable through insulation of the university system from the political system. The starting point in this regard is for the federal and state governments to abolish the practice of meddling in appointment of principal officers of the universities, including vice chancellors and members of university governing councils. Although theoretically possible, it is difficult in practice, for a vice chancellor appointed on the basis of political patronage to resist appointment, promotion, enrolment of students and discharge of oversight duties on the same basis. While the distortionary effects of political patronage on incentive systems are generally non-trivial; the perverse incentive effects are most pronounced and most destructive in knowledge creation environments. In recognition of this sensitivity, the right to self-governance of universities is considered a fundamental right. This recognition is reflected in Section C, Articles 11 and 12 of the Kampala Declaration on Intellectual Freedom and Social Responsibilities (1990) of the International Human Rights Conventions and Declarations, which state:\n“Institutions of higher education shall be autonomous of the State or any other public authority in conducting their affairs, including the administration, and setting up their academic, teaching research and other related programmes. The autonomy of institutions of higher education shall be exercised by democratic means of self-government, involving active participation of all members of the respective academic community.”\nThe current practice where professors lobby (some practically prostrate themselves to the ground for) politicians and ministers for appointment to the position of vice chancellor is shameful, and is both inconsistent and incongruent with the natural pride of the university system in its professional independence, progression by merit and advancement through creativity. In progressive countries, appointment of the chief executive of a university begins with the search committee and ends with the governing council, not “the Minister of Education in consultation with the National Universities Commission.” The argument perennially put forward in support of the current practice is “he who pays the piper dictates the tune,” that is, if government funds an educational institution, it should have a say in who heads it, a code phrase for political patronage! Of course, this will only be heard in countries where governments simply think about giving education to its population in order to reduce illiteracy rate or fertility rate (typical among Africans!). It will never be heard in countries where the university system is regarded as foremost to creativity, innovation and international competitiveness (ask South Koreans!).\nOnce self-governance is settled, the next challenge is establishing and enforcing strong academic standards in terms of who gets in, the quality of instruction they receive and the quality of research produced in the universities. These are the most important issues that keep the leaders of world leading universities awake at night. It is not every secondary school graduate that should be admitted into universities; it is the top ranking ones who should make it there. Currently, an average or bottom-ranking secondary school graduate can make it there if his/her parent is connected or knows somebody who is connected to a principal officer of a university. All that is required is for the applicant’s name to show up on the JAMB/UTME list of applicants by whatever means. If the students would not ordinarily make it to the list, the parents could buy a slot in it, or if that is difficult, they could enroll the ward in an examination center where cheating is not corruption! Some universities have made post-UTME exam mandatory in order to weed out such kids from getting in, but there are many challenges to the algorithms. The private universities are there to admit kids rejected by the public universities once the parents can afford their fees. So, the kids who should not be in the university are there, Pronto! The second area where standard is essential is the quality of instruction and mentoring offered at the universities. The most important concern of governance of leading universities is summed up in the question “what do we make of these smart kids?” The university system works like any other production system that transforms input into output. Academic and teaching staff that are not close to the frontier of knowledge cannot produce graduates that are ready for the world of work.\nNigerian universities are full of several kinds of characters. Some characters do not show up in class until few weeks to end of semester; a phenomenon that started in early 1990s when economic conditions became hard-hitting and full-time lecturers worked effectively as part-time instructors in their position, and continues today. There are some who simply dictate lecture notes they wrote 10 to 15 years prior when they were undergraduates taking the classes they are now teaching. Some classes have no textbooks, students are only required to read the lecturer’s handout. Some recommended and required textbooks are 20 years or more behind the frontier of global knowledge. When it comes to examinations, the best students are those who can repeat verbatim what the lecturer said or dictated in class, or wrote in the handout, word-for-word, definition-for-definition, illustration-for-illustration. The university system has a very weak or no mechanism at all that allows students to evaluate their instructors, neither does it have a system that regulates the standard of publications required for academic staff progression. Departments and programs in good universities around the world have standard lists of reputable, ranked journals, a list of which is provided to all academic staff, where publications would be regarded as meeting a particular standard, along with numbers expected to be published in specified categories in order to be promoted. The practice in Nigerian universities to simply count the number of publications creates perverse incentives that have severely limited scholarship. The falling standard of education in Nigeria is well acknowledged by parents and employers. However, it is not the result of any form of genetic mutation in the population, where invasion of the country by “less smart” aliens during the last 20 years is perhaps leading to reduction in the proportion of smart kids in the population. The fault lines are in the quality of intakes and the quality of instruction.\nOnce self-governance and standards issues are resolved, the university systems is now set for its original mission of generating innovation, producing high quality graduates, and addressing the development challenges of society. Resources from government and industry in the form of research, conference and professional development grants are needed to spur innovation. Institutions that fund research, experimentation and surveys such as National Science Foundation and National Institutes for Research and Experimentation should be established, alongside efforts to develop the capacity of National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to undertake regular large-scale surveys. An Act of parliament that declares these institutions as “Institutions of National Importance” may be helpful, but essentially they must create the mechanism to fund the institutions through regular statutory allocations from the government. This challenge must not be left for the Federal Government alone to tackle, States must do the same. From historical experience, government takes the lead in funding research and development while industry takes the back seat. Once a threshold of capacity for innovation is attained, the private sector typically moves to the front seat afterward.\nOnce the core of the innovation economy is strong and productive, the remaining pillars typically begin to develop and build on the foundation. Enterprise finance markets that provide capital for young entrepreneurs,11 and venture capital markets are more likely to be deepened as capacity for innovation improves. The business economy transforms gradually and so does the technological structure of the economy.  And the process continues. As the popular Pizza Hut advertisement goes, people and resources “gather around the good stuff!”"

    "title": "Medical Tourism, Demographic and Nigeria’s Health System",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Medical tourism refers to cross-border movement of people to receive medical, dental or surgical care, driven by affordability, accessibility or better quality of care than is available in the home country or region. It represents a growing market that connects the healthcare, tourism and hospitality industries.\nThe global medical tourism market is estimated at US$38.5-55.0billion based on estimated 11 million cross-border patients and per capita expenditure of US$3500-5000 per visit in 2014. The industry is estimated to grow at 15-25% per annum, faster than any individual economy around the world. The growth of the industry is driven by advances in information-communications technology, decreasing cost of international travels, changes in transnational disease patterns, and asymmetries healthcare industry developments around the world.\nAlthough the industry had existed since ancient times, when ancient Greeks and Egyptians went in search of health-enhancing hot springs and baths, its growth became noticeable in the 18th and 19th centuries when middle-class Europeans and Americans flocked to health spas and sanitariums even in remote places in the hope of finding treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis, gout, bronchitis or liver diseases.\nIn the 20th century, medical tourism was driven prominently by wealthy people traveling from developing countries in search of advanced healthcare in developed countries. However, the 21st century emerging pattern involves travels from more developed countries to less developed countries and within regions in search of affordable treatments.\nMedical tourism is driven by a combination of push and pull factors. Patients in advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada where universal health coverage (or socialized medicine) results in long waiting times for treatment often seek treatment in countries where they would not have to wait; high costs of healthcare in the United States induce patients to seek treatment in countries such as Mexico and India where prices are affordable; immigrants travel back to their home countries to receive care in health systems they are familiar with; expatriates return to countries in which they once lived and arrange care in facilities offering what they regard as high-quality, comparatively low-cost and consumer-oriented treatment; patients in need of medical interventions not approved in home countries (for example stem cell injections of unknown therapeutic effect and risk) travel to countries including China, India and Ukraine where such restrictions are less binding; and others travel overseas for procedures that are illegal in their home countries (for example commercial kidney transplant) to destinations where they are not challenged by laws.\nThe top specialties for medical travelers are cosmetic surgery, dentistry (general, restorative and cosmetic), cardiovascular surgeries (angioplasty, CABG, transplants), orthopedics (joint and spine; sports medicine), cancer treatments (often high-acuity or last resort), reproductive health (fertility, IVF, women’s health), weight loss surgeries (LAP-BAND, gastric bypass) and scans, tests, health screenings and second opinions.\nCurrent top global destinations for medical tourism are Costa Rica, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. In the African region, South Africa and Tunisia are listed as the leading earners from medical tourism. Tourists are attraction to these destinations primarily by advances in healthcare and reputation for clinical excellence, political transparency and commitment to international standards, and the state of tourism infrastructure. Being the primary source of attraction, advances in healthcare are driven by innovations, clinical quality assurance, and improvements in health infrastructure. Both government and private sector investments are critical to these advances.\nDemographics play an overwhelming role in growth and development of medical tourism from both supply and demand sides. The population of top medical tourism destinations are dominated by early-to-mid adults; population age (median years) range between 27 in India and 40 in South Korea.[i] In addition, the top specialties for medical tourism are associated with health consumption of mid-to-late adults.\nCountries with young populations are less likely to have the resources and pressure to develop the kind of health system that is required for the industry; infectious diseases are prominent and are the central emphasis of the health system and health investments in those countries. Similarly, countries with aging populations are less likely to find the space and resources to undertake the essential investments; they are saddled with chronic and degenerative diseases that require the most expensive types of treatment and prolonged care which constitute substantial drains on public investments in needed infrastructure.\nCountries in intermediate but advanced stages of the demographic transition are endowed with dominantly middle-age adult population and have the greatest potentials for medical care exports. While health needs and demands of the population generates the pressure needed to innovate and develop healthcare services at home, their consumption of those services creates the incentives for further innovation and development-focused investments. If the conditions are right, a country with such endowment could generate substantial life cycle savings driven by labor income that could fund substantial investments in infrastructure, while taxation income could support research and innovation. Demographics also play an important role in shaping governance and private sector development. Demand for democratic governance and pressure on governance systems for transparency are significantly strengthened by an energetic adult population. Private sector development is driven by entrepreneurship and innovation that are associated mostly with vibrant early-to-mid adult population.\nIt is estimated that 30,000 Nigerians travel abroad every year for medical care and spend about $1billion in the process, and about a quarter of the sum was spent in India in 2012. Realization of the potential benefits to the economy if such expenditures are retained locally has prompted several reactions including calls for restriction of government sponsorship of public officials and channeling of more resources toward the health sector. The private sector health alliance has recently launched a new initiatives to address management capacity gaps in the health sector in order to stem the tide of these imports. While these initiatives are helpful, it is unclear that they can make substantial impacts on the health system in the absence of a coordinated effort to take a wholesome look at the health sector.\nNigeria is a young country with median population age of 18.2 years. Communicable diseases accounted for 66 percent of deaths in 2014 with non-communicable diseases and injuries making up 24 percent and 10 percent respectively. Thus the epidemiological profile is dominantly infectious, and efforts and resources are currently devoted to prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, among which malaria is predominant. However health service needs will shift toward treatment of non-communicable diseases as the country progresses through the demographic transition. Getting the health system ready to respond to the needs of the changing demographics requires different types of investment. The potential for Nigeria to become a medical tourism earner and reduce import of medical services depends on coordination of efforts to meet the healthcare needs emerging along the demographic transition.\nDeliberate efforts, programs and policies that galvanize both private and public sector resources are needed to create a ready system. While health system infrastructure strengthening, upgrade and development are essential, research, innovations and clinical quality assurance are critical for advancement of the health system and development of medical tourism. Central to these outcomes is a culture of knowledge development through data collection, management, analysis and interpretation, and engagement of decision makers at various levels of the healthcare system, through both operational and policy levels, to use the knowledge and discoveries in making needed changes and implementing proffered solution to existing challenges. The quality of human resources for health depends on the depth of this culture; it is difficult to imagine a system of health training that is more sophisticated than the depth of knowledge generated through its healthcare system.\nNigeria is currently not positioned for medical service export neither can it restrict its import, owing to unfavorable demographics, weak infrastructure, lack of innovation and a poor culture of knowledge development and management. However, demographic conditions would change in near future and present opportunities to develop the export market. The question is whether the health system will be prepared!\n[i] Median age in years for the remaining countries are Costa Rica (30.0), Israel (29.9), Malaysia (27.7), Mexico (27.3), Singapore (33.8), Taiwan (39.2), Thailand (36.2), Turkey (29.6) and the United States (37.8)."

    "text": "2.1 Introduction and Purpose\nUnderstanding the epidemiological profile of a territory is necessary to evaluate and address public health needs. Reliable and appropriate health metrics aid policy development, proper health management, evidence-based decision-making, rational resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation of health services and policy. Population health data is becoming an effective and increasingly utilized tool in efforts to treat widespread health problems. Health data has also played an important role in the design and implementation of community-wide health initiatives implemented to promote good health practices. While the demand for health information is increasing in terms of quantity and quality, the response to these needs has been hampered because of fragmentation and major gaps and weaknesses in national health information systems. Insufficient track of epidemiological events has long plagued Sokoto State. Information is poor on progress, success or consequent failure of programs and interventions. As a result, proper health planning and interventions have been stalled affecting the general health welfare of the Sokoto population. In order to fill this breach, accurate and enough informant should be collated and made easily assessible to the general public further enhancing health planning. Failure to this will not only result in public health issues but affect the economic growth of Sokoto state. The present effort is a modest attempt to describe the epidemiological profile of Sokoto from the past and contemporary perspective. This profile will also aid in evaluating the successes achieved as well as caution against the daunting challenges awaiting the state. Variation in the population age structure, altered lifestyles of population attest to the demographic, development and health transition occurring in the state. Population stabilization, life-style modification, surveillance and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases constitute the major challenges demanding urgent attention in the future. The main objective of this project to construct an epidemiological profile, which would serve as a tool to monitor progress of the health of Sokoto, enable efficient program planning and management. Furthermore, this will provide the information needed by health policy and decision-makers. The public health issues facing the states are presented in the following sections: communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, injuries and accidents and other important health information. Each section focuses on analyzing past as well as current situations, providing policymakers with evidence and forecasts for planning."

    "text": "2.2 Data Sources\nPrimarily, the main sources of the data presented in the report are from the WHO and UN agency databases which in turn, rely on surveys as their primary sources: Demographic and health surveys (DHS), Multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS), Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS) and Standardized monitoring and assessment of relief and transitions (SMART) surveys. Information on indicators that are not collected in routine surveys was obtained from modelled estimates available from public sources (such as, the National Bureau of Statistics), status reports, and reviews, journal publications. Health data on Sokoto state are difficult to assess and often unavailable. When unavailable, assumptions were made based on recommended standards.\nMajor causes of mortality in Sokoto State (2016) was estimated to assess disease impact to the population. To obtain a proper representation of various mortality factors and their corresponding effects, it became pertinent to describe Sokoto’s mortality profile with a proportional mortality; a ratio of individual mortality cause to the total mortality, showing the percentage each disease contributed. [1]. Sokoto’s proportional mortaility was computed based on data from the Sokoto State Health Strategic plan (HHSP-II) of 2016 [2] . In addition, some assumptions were made based on experts’ opinion and WHO standards for missing data. Death from several diseases were then expressed as a ratio of the total death in Sokoto. The proportions were represented as percentages. An Excel template was created to capture prevalence and incidence data for indicators discussed."

    "text": "2.3 State Context\nSokoto State is located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria, and subdivided into 23 local government areas (LGAs). The State covers a land area of approximately 27,825 square kilometers, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills has its topography dominated by a rolling peneplain [3,4]. The state experiences its rainy season from June to October, with cold and dry north eastern winds known as the “Harmattan” occurring frequently from December through March [5] . The economic activity in Sokoto is agriculture, in addition to exploitation of natural resources. More than 90% of the population engaged in subsistence farming [5] . The state is one of the fish producing areas of the country, thus, many people along the river basins engage in fishing activities. Large-scale farming is practiced in the State using irrigation water. There are all kinds of animals both wild and domestic in the State. Sokoto ranks second in livestock production in the country with animal population of well over 8 million. Minerals such as Kaolin, Gypsum limestone, laterite, Red mills, Phosphate, both yellow and green shade clay, sand etc. are available in the State in commercial quantities. The availability of these economic potentials provides good investment opportunities, particularly in agro-allied industries such as flour mills, tomato processing, sugar refining, textiles, glue, tanning, fish canning and dairy.\nThe Sokoto State Ministry of Health (SMOH), like other Nigerian states, has overall responsibility for the health sector. The State Ministry of Health is responsible for advising government on policy formulation, regulation and implementation of health and health related issues in the state. Organization of the health delivery system in Sokoto State conforms to a three-tiered system: tertiary, secondary and primary level care. The people of the state are majorly Muslims and Islam provides them with code of conduct that influences their day-to-day activities, such as the emphasis on cleanliness in all aspects of life. Hence, in Sokoto state, there are strict injunctions regarding private and public hygiene derived from their Islamic law, which if applied will improve overall well-being of dwellers [6]."

    "section": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases",
    "text": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\nDiseases Communicable diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens that people spread to one another through contact with contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, blood products, insect bites, or through the air [14]. Most common forms of spread include fecal-oral, food, sexual intercourse, insect bites, contact with contaminated fomites, droplets, or skin contact. Some of the leading communicable disease in Nigeria include HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, malaria, meningitis, diarrheal diseases, syphilis and lower respiratory tract infections [15]. Regarding CDs in general, the interplay of agent, host and environment factors lead to a dynamic state of health and disease. New or emerging illnesses are often caused by organisms already in the environment and which become infectious due to altered conditions in the ecology[9]. This occurrence could be as a result of poor hygiene and unsafe sanitation (e.g. open defecation by adult and unhygienic disposal of children feces-a prevalent practice), poor utilization of health personnel for maternal health care (In 2011, 87.7% pregnant women aged 15-49 years used their homes for delivery whilst 11.7% and 0.6% visited public and private health facilities) which are major risk factors especially in rural communities in Sokoto State [16].\nCommunicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto state [8]. Sokoto state has long been plagued by communicable diseases notably: malaria, leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhea, whooping cough, HIV and meningitis as far back as the nineties tetanus [8]. Based on the proportional mortality that was estimated (2016), CDs along with maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions in Sokoto State accounted for an estimated 73% of all deaths - a high figure especially in contrast with developed countries (deaths due to communicable diseases in the United States of America was 5% only in 2016) [17]. Common communicable diseases plaguing Sokoto state are discussed below:\n\n4.1.1 HIV/AIDS\nThe first case of AIDS was reported in Nigeria in 1986. The current national prevalence of HIV is estimated at 1.4% (15-49 years), with a total estimated 1.9 million persons living with HIV in Nigeria [18]. Prevalence among females is significantly higher at an estimated 1.9%, with male prevalence estimated at 0.9% [18]. In 2014, about 136,833 people were living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Sokoto out of a projected population of about 5 million [19].\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto has fluctuated substantially over the years. The first HIV Sentinel Survey in 1991 showed a prevalence of 1.8% [20]. Subsequent sentinel surveys produced prevalence of 1.6% (1993), 2.7% (1999), 2.8% (2001), 4.5% (2003), 3.2% (2005), 6.0% (2008) and 3.3% (2010) [19]. Based on the recent National Aids Indicator Survey (2018), HIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto state is estimated to have reduced to 0.4% (15-49) years in 2018; making them one of the low prevalence states in Nigeria with a disease burden of 12,844 approximately 0.013% of the burden in low prevalence states [18].\n\n\n\nFigure 3. HIV Prevalence Trends in Sokoto state (1991-2018). Source: Nigeria ANC Surveillance Report 2010; National Aids Indicator Survey, 2019.\n\n\nNew infections are primarily from key populations , especially female sex workers and their partners in the general population [18]. The HIV prevalence in the urban areas is lower than the rural areas in Sokoto State. In these rural towns and villages, risk is driven by variations in sexual behaviors such as casual, transactional and sex work; with female sex workers ranking high as the source of new infections Beyond behavioral risk factors, environmental and systemic factors also constitute risks for HIV infection. Transfusion of infected blood and blood products and poor handling and disposal of highly infectious wastes generated in healthcare settings increase the risk for HIV transmission [18].\nIn addition, other structural drivers play a role in the HIV epidemic in Sokoto. These include those socio-cultural factors that increase people’s vulnerability to HIV infection such as: poverty, gender inequality-inability of women to demand condom use due to male dominance over women’s reproductive rights, extra-marital sex and/or multiple sex partners, female genital mutilation and levirate marriage (Widow Inheritance), disempowering women from seeking HIV prevention or treatment services without the permission of their husbands/partners, human rights violations and the persistence of HIV and AIDS- related stigma and discrimination [18].\nMortality due to AIDS in Sokoto have considerably reduced over the years. This decreased by 14% from 2016-2018. As at 2016, AIDS death contributes to 2 percent only of the total mortality rates in Sokoto State. [2]. This accomplishment might as well be credited to successful intervention programs.\n\n\n4.1.2 Tuberculosis\nSeveral infectious diseases once considered to be controlled have re-emerged to become major public health problems of a greater magnitude than was previously the case; tuberculosis is one of such. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium spp. There are two types of human tuberculosis: Pulmonary and Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. A study conducted to determine the species of Mycobacterium involved in cases of human tuberculosis in Sokoto State indicated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (69.23%) has remained the major causative organism causing tuberculosis in Sokoto, followed by Mycobacterium bovis (20.51%) and finally the atypical mycobacterium (10.26%) [21].\nIn 2006, a total of 1,383 of all forms of cases were registered out of which 92% (1,265) tested sputum smear positive [22]. However, this increased to 3,329 in 2013 with 67% (2,170) testing sputum smear positive. The rate of relapse remained fluctuating from 2009-2013. Nevertheless, the number of failed treatment cases reduced by 1% (2008-2013) [23]. Individuals within the age group of 25-34 years had the highest infection rate while those within the age group of 0-14 years had the least infection. Overall, males were affected more than females probably as a result of high exposure. The number of Direct Observed Treatment Short course centers (DOTS) increased progressively from 2008 to 2013 which improved treatment access to TB patients. Hence, DOTS can be credited to be one of factors resulting to a reduction in the total number of cases rate [23].\nNigeria has a high degree of overlap between HIV and TB infected population among 15-49 years age group. The recorded HIV prevalence among TB patients has risen from 2.2% in 1991 to 19.1% in 2001 and an estimated 27% in 2003 [24]. The TB/HIV co-infection rate of 27%, suggests that about 800,000 persons have both HIV and TB infection. At this rate, an additional burden of 50,000 TB cases annually is added from the HIV infected people [25]. Prevalence rates of HIV, HBsAg and HCV among TB patients vary from region to region in Nigeria. In 2016, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was 5.6% (2.2% female and 3.3% male) in Sokoto State. The female to male ratio of TB patients was 1:2.9, while the ratio of co-infection of HIV among TB patients for female to male was 1:1.5 [26]. Co-infection occurred in age range of 21-40 years only, with age group 31 – 40 years having the highest prevalence of co-infection [26]. This high prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was observed in younger sexually active age group. In 2018, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients increased to 16.3%. Prevalence of HBsAg and HCV among TB patients was 14.9% and 5.4% respectively [27]. In addition, prevalence of co-infection of HIV-HBsAg-HCV in TB patients was 1.45% in 2018 [27]. The causes of HIV-HBV-HCV co-infection has been associated with parenteral, sexual and vertical transmission, and sharing of injections by injection drug users.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Leprosy is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities [28]. Cases of leprosy are usually classified as either paucibacillary leprosy (PB) or multibacillary leprosy (MB). This classification is based on counting the number of skin lesions and is primarily used for the purposes of chemotherapy, as PB cases are treated for 6 months and MB cases for 12 months using different regimens [29].\nBefore 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy endemic countries in the world. Surveys in the 1940s and 1950s found prevalence rates ranging from 16-390 per 10,000. In 1991, country wide leprosy prevalence rate of 30.3 per 10,000 was estimated [30]. Although Nigeria achieved the targeted prevalence level for the elimination of leprosy before the year 2000 and attained low endemicity to a large extent, incidences have still being noted since then [30].\nLeprosy cases in Sokoto dropped by approximately 76% from 2006 to 2013 (with a total registered case of 263 in 2006 and 63 in 2013) [23]. This can be attributed to the success of the Multi-drug therapy introduced to Nigeria in 1985 and launched with the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program (NTBLCP) in 1991 together with the discharge of inactive or wrongly diagnosed patients, adoption of the WHO 12-month MB treatment regimen and massive discharge of all patients on the former 24-month regimen that had received more than 12 doses [30].\nIn 2009, 225 leprosy cases registered, 62% (139) were males including children and adults whilst 38% were females (86). This however declined to 86 registered cases in 2013; 73% males and 27% females . Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age. In 2009 about 7.5% of children were affected by leprosy among all the registered cases [31], which increased to 19% of children in 2011 [32] but declined slightly to 15% of children in the year 2013-indicating a high level of leprosy transmission [23]. The pre-dominant type of leprosy in Sokoto state is the MB while lesser cases of leprosy is the PB. MB proportion increased progressively from 91% in 2009 to all forms of leprosy cases falling into the MB classification by 2013, implying longer treatment regimens for patients as well as increased risk of transmission since MB is commonly classified as the infectious leprosy [30].\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Trend of Registered Leprosy cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Tuberculosis and Control Program, 2009-2013.\n\n\nThe WHO disability leprosy grading system has been in use for years. Its main application has been used as an indicator for early case detection/reporting [33]. This grading system varies from 0 to 2; with 2 being the most severe. The rate of WHO Grade 2 disability decreased significantly from 19% to 9% during a one-year interval from 2011-2012. This falling disability rate indicates that new cases were increasingly diagnosed before they developed visible deformities. Thus, representing an improved promptness in case detection. Crude death rate due to leprosy has being fluctuating from 4.7 per 100,000 in 2010, 3.1 per 100, 000 in 2011 and 5.5 per 100,000 in 2012. This variation in the number of deaths may be indicative of an unstable treatment regimen. Efforts ought to be put in place to ensure this is effective [23,31,32].\n\n\n4.1.4 Malaria\nMalaria accounts for 40% of public health expenditure. 30 - 50% of in-patient admissions and up to 50% of out-patient visits in areas with high malaria transmission [34]. Malaria is endemic throughout Nigeria with seasonal variation in different geographic zones of the country. More than 90% of the total population is at risk of malaria and at least 50% of the population suffers from at least one episode of malaria each year [35]. Malaria has long plagued Sokoto State like other Nigerian states. However, there have been improvements over the years. This may be as a result of three major control interventions: insecticide treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) [36].\nGender-specific infection rate in Sokoto showed that males had the higher infection rate than females. There are no scientific facts to explain this phenomenon, however, suggestions have been made that this high prevalence rate could just be by chance, or due to the fact that males engage in activities which make them more prone to infective mosquito bites in comparison to their female counterparts, that are mostly at home and protected from such infective bites [35]. The age group 0 - 5 years had the highest infection rate followed by 6 - 10 and 11 - 15 years age groups [35]. Among children aged 6-59 months with malaria parasites, the dominant species of malaria parasites is Plasmodium falciparum specie (&gt;90%) with P. malaria playing a minor role [37].\nMalaria prevalence among children under 5 was measured in the 2015 National Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) and 66% of the children tested positive for malaria when RDTs were used to detect the presence of parasites while 46.6% tested positive when microscopy was used. The prevalence is higher with RDTs than with microscopy as expected because false positive test results are possible with RDTs [37]. This have been proven true by other studies, which have shown a higher prevalence of malaria using RDTs instead of microscopy [38,39].\nThe percentage of children with malaria is much higher in rural than in urban areas [37] as a result of poor environmental sanitation, which provides adequate breeding sites for the malaria parasite. Malaria prevalence decreases as the mother’s education level and wealth quintile status increase; which could be as a result of knowledge of preventive measures to malaria infection and access to cleaner as well as safer environs [37].\nUse of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is one of the most effective measures used to prevent malaria. Between May 2009 and November 2013, the government of Nigeria, with support from several partners, distributed approximately 52 million mosquito nets across the country. Overall in Sokoto (2015), 79% of households had at least one mosquito net, 77% had at least one ITN, and 77% percent had at least one LLIN. By 2018, 84% of households having at least one mosquito net, an average number of two ITNs per household and 39% having at least one net for every two persons in the household. [7]. Rural households are more likely to own at least one ITN than urban households [11].\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Malaria cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Bureau Statistics, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Malaria Deaths in Sokoto State (2006-2016). Source: WHO Global Malaria Program Estimates, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Diarrhea\nEach year, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea occur among children under five years of age, and estimates suggest that overall incidence has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, more than half of these cases are in Africa and South Asia, where bouts of diarrhea are more likely to result in death or other severe outcome . Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children in Nigeria; responsible for about 16% of child’s death every year. Nigeria was estimated to have a total number of annual child deaths due to diarrhea to be 151,700 [40].\nRotavirus has been identified among the most important cause of infantile diarrhea especially in developing countries. Reports have shown that 39% of diarrhea episodes seen at health centers were rotavirus positive . In 2015, the prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea accounted for 25.5% of diarrhea cases among children younger than five years of age presented to hospitals in Sokoto metropolis [41]. In Sokoto, diarrhea is most common among children age 12–23 months and least common among those age 48-59 months. Diarrhea with blood was also most common in children aged 12-23 months. Children of mothers with no education were twice as likely as children of mothers with more than a secondary education to have had diarrhea [42].\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Diarrhea prevalence in children under five 2008-2013. Source: NDHS, 2013\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Schistosomiasis\nAbout 252 million individuals might be affected worldwide with the disease [43]. Globally, the disease is on the increase in both prevalence and incidence because of the expansion of irrigated agriculture which provides habitats for vector snails; construction of hydro-electricity generating sites; lack of good sanitary habits; and lack of safe water for the growing population [44]. In Nigeria, three species are pathogenic to man: S. haematobium, S. mansoni and S. intercalatum [45].\nBoth intestinal and urinogenital schistosomiasis occur in Nigeria. Previous research has documented prevalence rates between 14.2% and 91.4% [46,47]. Schistosomiasis is typically more prevalent in children than adults. In a study, findings revealed that males within the age group 10-14 years recorded highest prevalence than females. Perhaps, as a result of frequent water contact by males in cercariae infested areas around the river [48].\nIn 2016, the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis (children) in Sokoto state was 60.80% and 2.93% for intestinal schistosomiasis. The prevalence of the infection by water contact activities showed that children who were involved in farming and children who swim and fish had the highest and second-highest rates respectively. Likewise, those who contact river and dam water for bathing, fetching and washing had similar pattern [45]. Children whose source of drinking water were dams, ponds and rivers had the highest prevalence in contrast with children that drink water from wells and boreholes- with the least prevalence.\nPrevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis is low, which may be because intestinal schistosomiasis is transmitted by Biomphalaria sps. of snails, whose presence is very low-slung in northern Nigerian regions. In contrast, high prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis may be attributed to high occurrence of vector snails of Bulinus sps. in the local water bodies of northern Nigeria [49] and high dependence on untreated water from natural water (especially amongst rural dwellers) where infection may set in, since schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and frequent contact of the population with fresh water may lead to high infection rates and constant re-infection [45].\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Schistosomiasis prevalence in children Source: Kabiru et al., 2013.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Polio\nNigeria is a major reservoir of poliovirus in the world and until recently the only country with ongoing transmission of all three serotypes namely: wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3), and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Nigeria is one of the three remaining endemic countries. As at 2005, Nigeria was responsible for about half of the global burden of polio [50].\nEnvironmental surveillance has repeatedly detected cVDPVs in Sokoto since mid-2013. An Environmental sampling conducted during 2014 detected 16 cVDPV2 in Sokoto [51]. The last reported case of poliomyelitis due to wild poliovirus type 2 was reported in 1999 and wild poliovirus type 2 was officially certified as eradicated in September 2015 [52]. In Sokoto State, four genetically related viruses were isolated from four environmental samples collected between 24 April and 9 May 2018; no associated case of acute flaccid paralysis has been detected, as the virus was isolated only from environmental samples. In October 2016, an unrelated circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreak and subsequently Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) events occurred in Sokoto State [53].\nNigeria mounted a massive vaccine response with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine (mOPV2) and Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), even surpassing outbreak guidelines. However, Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) has persisted in Sokoto [54]. This indicates that there is a high number of unimmunized children which threaten to sustain transmission. Improving the quality and oversight of the Sokoto program is an urgent priority to head off a resurgence of Type 2 disease nation-wide, particularly as immunity levels drop following the withdrawal of Trivalent oral polio vaccine and continued weak routine immunization [54]. However, the polio eradication program over the years have proven somewhat successful. 21st August 2019 marks three years since Nigeria last reported a case of wild poliovirus. This is an important public health milestone for the country and the entire Africa Region, with a step closer to being certified as polio-free [53].\n\n\n4.1.8 Meningitis\nCerebrospinal meningitis is a major public health problem still affecting tropical countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It is highly contagious and mortality from the disease remains high, despite major achievements in the treatment modalities. Outbreaks of Neisseria Meningitides (Nm) type C has been on the increase since 2013 in Sokoto state in Northwest, Nigeria. Eight hundred and fifty-six (856) cases were reported in Sokoto state in 2013 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 6.8%. The 2015 figure gives an alarming 5-fold rise in the number of cases seen compared to that of 2014. This implies it could get worse in subsequent years if no public health measures are put in place to stop the trend [55]."

    "text": "4.2 Maternal & Reproductive Health\n\n4.2.1 Maternal Health\nThree-quarters of all maternal deaths occur during delivery and immediate post-partum period. The single most critical intervention for safe motherhood is to ensure a competent health worker with mid-wifery skill is present at every birth [56]. A world fit for children goal is to ensure that women have ready and available access to skilled attendance at delivery. The indicators include the proportion of births with a skilled attendant and proportion of institutional deliveries. About 7.4% of births occurring in 2011 (Sokoto) were delivered by skilled personnel (2.5% Doctor, 4.9% Nurses and Mid-Wife). This increased to 20.6% in 2017 (7.7% doctors, 12.9% Nurses and Mid-Wives) [56].\nIncreasing the proportion of births that are delivered in health facilities is an important factor in reducing the health risks to both the mother and the baby. Proper medical attention and hygienic conditions during delivery can reduce the risks of complications and infections that can cause morbidity and mortality to either the mother or the baby. A large percentage of pregnant women in Sokoto deliver in their respective homes- 92.6% in 2011. However, a decrease to 87.7% was noted in 2017, with the rest delivery occurring in health facilities (Public and Private Facilities) [56].\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Causes of Maternal Deaths Sokoto - 2016. Source: Sokoto State Health Development Plan-II, 2016\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Vesico-vaginal Fistula\nVesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) is a devastating and debilitating condition which profoundly hampers the quality of life of women. Despite improvement in health care delivery systems and advancement in surgical techniques, VVF continues to be a major health problem [57]. Predisposing factors to obstetric fistula include early age at delivery, home delivery, early marriage, obstructed labor, unskilled birth attendant, economic and socio-cultural factors among others.\nProlonged obstructed labor is the main cause of obstetric fistula in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive at 96.5% [58]. It is a preventable and treatable disease commonly found among the poor population- young women and illiterate girls, who mainly live in the rural communities with difficulty in accessing emergency obstetric care and areas with limited or under-utilized skilled birth attendants [58]. Most of the vesicovaginal fistula patients in northern Nigeria had early marriages: 93.6% of Sokoto patients were married before or at 18 years of age [59]."

    "text": "4.3 Nutritional Deficiencies\nNutrition plays an essential component in the evaluation of a child’s growth and health. Children’s physical development is an important indicator of a society’s welfare. It reflects socioeconomic, food safety and environmental conditions [60]. The living conditions (i.e., socioeconomic, nutritional and environmental) to which children are exposed, influences their optimal growth potential [61]. Child malnutrition indicators are typically classified into: Acute Malnutrition, Underweight, Stunting and Overweight.\n\n4.3.1 Acute malnutrition (AM)\nAcute Malnutrition7 in children (6-59 months) is either moderate or severe. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)8 is an important indicator and the most dangerous form of malnutrition and closely linked to mortality risk [62]. A child with SAM has 9-fold increased risk of death compared to a child with no acute malnutrition [63]. Sokoto state had 9.8% Global Acute Malnutrition9 (GAM) and 1.0% Severe Acute Malnutrition coefficient in 2018, compared to its GAM of 10.5% and SAM of 2.4% in 2015, a slight change [62]. The estimates show a poor nutrition situation according to WHO classification of GAM rate of 5-9.9%. Sokoto has the fourth highest state prevalence in GAM and SAM of 8.4% and 2.0% respectively, evincing reflecting a poor nutritional status of the state. In 2015, Sokoto was above the warning threshold for GAM (10 &lt; GAM &lt;15) and WHO SAM crisis threshold of 2 percent [62].\nThe causes of malnutrition and food insecurity are multifaceted and include poor infant and young child feeding practices, which contribute to high rates of illness and poor nutrition among children under 2 years; lack of access to healthcare, water, and sanitation; armed conflict, particularly in the north; irregular rainfall; high unemployment; and poverty. Although chronic and seasonal food insecurity occurs throughout the country and is exacerbated by volatile and rising food prices, the impact of conflict and other shocks has resulted in acute levels of food insecurity.

    "section": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases",
    "text": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally, and one of the major health challenges of the 21st century. In 2016, they were responsible for 71% (41 million) of the 57 million deaths which occurred globally [64]. Non-communicable diseases are characterized as that which is non-infectious and of chronic nature. These include diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, neuro-degenerative disorders and injuries [65]. In the current global health context, ‘NCDs’ mainly refer to four diseases – diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory disease [65]. Nigeria is currently witnessing both demographic and epidemiologic transitions, which could be some of the possible reasons why the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing [66].\nIn Nigeria, research by WHO in 2016 shows that NCDs were estimated to account for 29% of all deaths (Cardiovascular diseases 11%, cancer 4%, diabetes 1%) [17]. Similar to the national pattern, NCDs less cancer was estimated to account for 21% of all deaths in Sokoto (Cardio vascular diseases 10%, Diabetes 2%) [2]. Though communicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto, the state is currently facing an increase in the burden of NCDs. The costs on society will therefore be staggering; the burden on the health system will be increasingly unsustainable, the loss from the workforce of adults in their prime will have profound effects on the fiscus and families, and communities will struggle to make ends meet. All these of course, is likely to be made worse by a rising population [67].\nThe focus of the health sector in most countries had been almost exclusively on healthcare services. However, because NCD risk factors lie in sectors beyond health, the key strategy to curb this rise is to use a multisectoral approach. Different sectors have different contributions to make towards solving this problem. Inability to curb this will lead to a bigger challenge future wise. Currently, NCDs contribute to 88% of all deaths in the USA (2016) -a huge burden yet to be tackled [17]\n\n4.4.1 Diabetes\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) was previously considered to be rare in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the prevalence is on the increase mainly because of urbanization and changes in lifestyle [68]. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide, and it is projected that by the year 2030 over 500 million adults will be affected by DM [69]. These large increases are predicted to occur mostly in developing countries and in adults especially between 45 and 64 years of age due to changes in lifestyles especially diet and physical inactivity [70]. These predictions indicate a growing burden of diabetes, particularly in developing countries. In 2011, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was about 2.7% in Nigeria [71].\nThe prevalence rate of 4.3% for DM in Sokoto was noted in 2017 amongst sub-urban dwellers [68]. The prevalence was slightly higher in men than women (4.5% vs. 4.0%) and differed significantly according to weight status or Body Mass Index classification. Prevalence of DM is still lower in rural (0.8%) than urban. This low prevalence of DM among rural dwellers could be attributed to the complementary traditional lifestyle, which depends on animal husbandry and subsistence economy [72]. The prevalence of DM increases with advancing age, a finding that is consistent with previous studies .\nWith respect to other blood sugar disorders, there was a relatively high prevalence of prediabetes defined as Impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) or Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) among a rural Fulani community in Wamakko Local Government area of Sokoto state [73]. The prevalence rates of IGT and IFG were 8 and 6.9% respectively This relatively high prevalence of IGT is similar to International Diabetes Federation estimates of about 8% prevalence rate for IGT in Nigeria [73] In urbanized Fulani, prevalence of 14.6% of IGT was recorded [74]. This is attributable to lifestyle changes associated with urbanization. Urban lifestyle in Africa is characterized by changes in dietary habits involving an increase in the consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, and reduction in fiber intake [75]. Urbanization tends to decrease physical activity as very little physical activity is required for daily living whereas rural populations rely on foot walk as transportation means and often have intense agricultural activities as their main occupation [72].\n\n\n4.4.2 Cancer\nCancer is a public health problem worldwide affecting all ages. It is the second commonest cause of death in developed countries and among the three leading causes of death in developing countries. WHO reported that about 24.6 million people live with cancer world-wide. There are 12.5% of all deaths attributable to cancer and if the trend continues, it is estimated that by 2020, 16 million new cases will be diagnosed per annum out of which 70% will be in the developing countries [76]. Cancer is an emerging non-communicable disease in sub-Sahara Africa. The pattern of cancer distribution in developed and sub-Saharan Africa vary significantly. While lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and urinary bladder carry more than 50% of cancer burden in Europe and America; the Sub-Saharan African region showed that breast, cervical, prostate, Lymphomas, gastrointestinal cancers carry more than 60% of cancer burden [77].\nAmong males in Sokoto state, the five most frequently reported cancers are bladder cancer (19.3%), prostate (9.9%) and non- hodgkin’s lymphoma (6.5%). The most frequent sites of cancers in females by rank order are breast (25.3%), followed by cervix uteri (14.1%) and ovary (5.6%). Almost half of the breast cancers were diagnosed in premenopausal women (in the 30-49 years age group), while cervical cancer tended to affect women a decade later. Significantly, bladder cancer did not appear to be frequent in females [78].\n\n\n4.4.3 Cardiovascular Diseases\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries and they are emerging as prominent public health problems in developing countries.\nThe prevalence of CVD in Sokoto (2009) was 52.60% in males and 47.40% in females [79] . The highest incidence of CVD was seen between the age ranges of 40-49 years while the lowest incidence was seen between the age ranges of 19 years. Hypertension, closely followed by stroke, is the most prevalent CVD while Chronic Heart Disease (CHD) is the least prevalent CVD in Sokoto Prevalence of hypertension (2017) was 23.6%. There is an age-related increase in the prevalence of hypertension. This is not surprising as blood pressure tends to rise with age and hence the possibility of a greater burden of hypertension as people live longer. The potential impact is the additional stretching of health resources, which is already failing the stress utilization test [80].\nCigarette smoking of any amount, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), diabetes mellitus, and advancing age have been identified as the major and independent risk factors for Chronic Heart Diseases (CHD). In 2017, the prevalence of dyslipidemia, total cholesterol and cigarette smoking in Sokoto was 3.5%, 6% and 7% respectively. These values are low possibly reflecting the low level of cholesterol in diet of most the people and nature of our occupation such as farming and transport system that force resident to engage in physical activity most at times strenuous [80]. Hypertension had the highest occurrence of mortality of all the CVD’s 30.85% while congenital heart disease had the lowest number of deaths 0.56% [79].\n\n\n4.4.4 Obesity\nObesity is a non-communicable medical disorder that has largely been accepted as reflection of healthy living and affluence among Nigerians. It is usually defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m 2 and is assuming an epidemic dimension [19].\nIn 2014, the prevalence rate of generalized obesity was 13.9% of which 1.7% had BMI&gt;40 kg/m 230.6% (11.4% in men and 19.2% in women), which was lower than the national prevalence rate observed in 2008 [66]. The higher rate of obesity in females may be related to their sedentary lifestyle in this part of country as many are full house wives, while males are more involved in physical activities arising from their farming occupations [80].\n\n\n4.4.5 Drug Use In Sokoto State\nIn 2017, prevalence of any drug use in Nigeria was estimated at 14.4% or 14.3 million people aged between 15 and 64 years. The extent of drug use in Nigeria is comparatively high when compared with the 2016 global annual prevalence of any drug use of 5.6% among the adult population . People who inject drugs constitute a sizeable proportion of high-risk drug users in Nigeria. The most common drugs injected in the past year were pharmaceutical opioids, followed by cocaine and heroin. While overall, more men were injecting drugs, women were more likely than men to report injecting heroin. The extent of risky injecting practices and sexual behaviors among the high-risk drug users and those who inject drugs is also of concern as is the extent of self-reported HIV among this group. Women who injected drugs were more likely than men to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors further compounding their risk for acquiring HIV among other infections [16]\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Prevalence of substance abuse in Sokoto State (2008-2013). Source: Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital Kware, Sokoto, 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Prevalence of Substance Abuse in Sokoto 2018. Source: Drug use in Nigeria, 2018\n\n\nThe prevalence of drug use in the North-West zone is estimated at 12% of the population. The use of cannabis and non-medical use of opioids (tramadol, codeine, morphine) and cough syrups (containing codeine or dextromethorphan) are also the most common in this zone [16]. A qualitative study was conducted to examine the abuse of cough syrup as a new trend in drug abuse among the youth in five (5) Northwestern States of Nigeria. The results show that 33% claimed to source the substances from chemists and pharmacies, 36% claimed to acquire the substance from Drug dealers (retail), while 23% claimed they obtained the substance from Drug dealers (Wholesale) [81]."

This is more so in the developing countries like Nigeria where increasing industrialization, high velocity vehicles, increasing ethno-religious clashes and recently widespread terrorist attacks have resulted in sudden, unexpected mass casualties presenting to secondary and/or tertiary health centers [82].\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Mortality and Morbidity rates of RTA (2010-2013). Source: National Bureau of Statistics, 2014\n\n\nThe number of deaths as a result of road traffic accidents increased by 6.2% (2010-2013) with a simultaneous increase to 2.2% injured persons within the same time interval [83]. This could be as a result of flouting traffic rules and regulations, poor use of seat belts by motorists, outright refusal to use seat belts and an influx of alternatives to vehicles such as motorcycles and tricycles. Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALWs) enable and extend violence which has enormous public health consequences too. Within a ten-year interval of 2003-2013, Sokoto state had a prevalence of 0.07% SALWs, with 14% fatality, and peak age range of 26–35 years being affected. The most common types of injuries were wounds, systemic organ injuries and fractures. Brain trauma, though not very common had 75% mortality while systemic organ injury had 24.6% mortality [84]."

We incorporated the term “Nigeria”, and the names of all 36 Nigerian States, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), into the search strategy to retrieve studies conducted in Nigeria. There were no search restrictions placed on study intervention, comparator, or outcomes. However, appropriate filters were applied to limit the search results to human studies published in English. The search strategy for peer-reviewed publications can be found in Appendix 1. Search results were imported into Covidence (Covidence Systematic Review Software) for study-screening and selection."

Studies assessing the effect of LARCs on non-pregnancy-related outcomes were excluded. For instance, we screened out papers investigating the impact of LARCs on electrolyte levels. We excluded studies without methods, such as case reports and case series, abstract-only publications, commentaries, and narrative reviews.\nTwo independent reviewers (CO and BN) screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, then reviewed full texts for inclusion. Voting conflicts were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (EA). The selection of articles was done in two phases. The initial phase involved a title and abstract screening of final search results after removal of duplicates. The second phase was a full-text assessment of papers retrieved after the initial screening to identify studies that met the eligibility criteria."

    "section": "3.2 Knowledge and awareness on LARC methods",
    "text": "3.2 Knowledge and awareness on LARC methods\nThe knowledge of LARCs is relatively low. In 2003, only 27 percent of Nigerian women had heard of IUDs, 57 percent of Injectables and 10 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004) . Nonetheless, by 2018, 46 percent of women had heard of IUDs, 82 percent of Injectables and 70 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019). Awareness of LARCs varied with geographical location, wealth quintile and education levels. Women living in rural, and less literate North East and North West zones were least likely to be informed on any method of long-acting contraception. In contrast, women residing in urban Southern regions, (especially South West) were well-educated on the different LARCs available to them. Expectedly, low levels of education and household income led to reduced knowledge and awareness of LARCs in recentrounds of NDHS(National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Knowledge of LARCs by method. Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey\n\n\nWomen obtained information on LARCs from various sources. Primarily, such information were from friends and family (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Ameh and Sule 2007; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Secondary sources included the media, workshops and seminars, and health workers (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Monjok et al. 2010; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olukoya 1991; Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005). This indicates the importance of ensuring that non-medical personnel have access to the right information on LARCs since most women are more likely to get their foremost information from informal sources. Second, it suggests that organizing community-directed outreaches centred on raising awareness and providing information on LARCs to community members may yield notable results since women are more inclined to learn about LARCs primarily from their immediate community (Olukoya 1991). Female students, however, sourced their information on LARCs primarily from social media and lectures (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). This may probably be due to the academic environment. The positive effect of this observation lies in the potential of increased awareness through seminar, workshops and social media adverts (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Female students who had previous induced abortion were significantly more knowledgeable about LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Their experience of an induced abortion may have triggered the quest to obtain information on more effective and reliable ways of preventing unplanned pregnancies. Parents often feel uncomfortable communicating issues bothering sex or in some cases, lack adequate information on LARCs. As a result, young females are more reluctant to get information on LARCs from them (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005).\nStudies had contrasting views on the influence of religion on the knowledge of LARCs. Some studies reported the effect of religious beliefs on the knowledge, awareness and subsequent use of LARCs. (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olaleye et al. 2014; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Christian women were reportedly more aware of LARCs than women belonging to other religions in Nigeria. This relationship may be confounded by the higher proportion of Christians in Southern Nigeria, where contraceptive prevalence is higher. (A. S. Adeyemi, Adekanle, and Komolafe 2008; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). In contrast, two studies conducted by Aduloju et al. (2021), and Orji and Onwudiegwu (2002) concluded religion did not have any meaningful effect on awareness of LARCs.\nThe gap between the Knowledge of LARCs and its actual usage is wide (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002). This suggests that awareness alone does not determine the utilization of LARCs by Nigerian women. The common reasons for this gap include lack of knowledge on provider centers, distance from the source of LARCs, adequate information on the benefits of LARCs, fear of possible side effects, fear of the procedure, husband disapproval, religion and culture (Aduloju et al. 2021; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001). Nigerian women often have misconceptions on the benefits and side effects of long-acting reversible contraception (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, there is the need to heighten awareness, to enable women make informed decisions while choosing a LARC method. Data from several rounds of NDHS suggests women who used injectables and IUDs were more informed on the side effects of these methods, what to do if they experienced side effects and other methods of long-acting contraception available to them than women who opted for Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). In the same surveys, LARC users were least likely to receive information about side effects or safety issues from a private medical facility than from a government hospital. The same was true of information on what to do if they experienced side effects."

    "text": "3.3 LARCs utilization prevalence and associated factors\nAlthough still under-utilized, the practice of Long-acting reversible contraception by Nigerian women have generally improved between 2003 and 2018 National Population Commission, and ORC Macro (2004); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2009); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2014); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2019); Onwuhafua et al. (2005)]. The CPR of LARCs increased steadily from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 7.4 percent in 2018 among married women using contraceptives. Nationally, about 14.8 percent of women currently using any method of contraception used LARCs. The prevalence LARCs was highest among women aged 35 years and above and lowest among those aged 15-24. Injectables and IUDs were the most frequently used LARC (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; BC Ozumba and Ibekwe 2001; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). The most common reasons for using any method of long-acting reversible contraception were safety, reversibility, effectiveness, long-term protection, convenience, husband’s approval, understanding of the LARC method, personal choice, the desire to have good maternal health, satisfaction with information given on insertion procedure and services rendered by the healthcare provider recommendation by another woman who had used the method, affordability, approval by religion and duration of the desired LARC (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; The RESPOND Project 2013).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Utilization of LARCs by method. Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey\n\n\nUse of LARCs varied with residence, region, level of education, number of living children, and economic status of the household. Married women residing in urban areas were more likely to use LARCs than their rural counterparts (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019; Onwuhafua et al. 2005). The South-West zone had the highest proportion of women using LARCs, followed by the South-South zone . The lowest proportion of married women using any LARC method were in the North-East LARC use increased with educational attainment across all geopolitical zones. By wealth quintile, women in the lowest quintile were least likely to use long-acting reversible contraception and women in the highest quintile were most likely to use them. The limited use of LARCs in rural areas persists for various reasons ranging from unavailability of the LARC methods to lack of proﬁciency in administering LARCs by rural care providers (Onwuhafua et al. 2005).\nUse of LARCs was relatively low among singles compared to married women (Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Olaleye et al. 2014; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). This may be because single women are less likely to source for contraception openly because of cultural and religious prohibition of premarital sex in Nigeria (Ijarotimi et al. 2015). The uptake of LARCs increased with parity; women do not begin to use LARCs until they have had at least one child (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Konje et al. 1998; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002). An attribute pointing to the reproductive need of women with less than 3 children and the popular consideration of LARC methods as an alternative to the sterilization method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015). Due to poor information on the use of LARCs, many healthcare providers were found reluctant to offer intrauterine contraceptive devices to women who have never had a live birth (Harper et al. 2008; Black et al. 2013). It is very crucial that misconceptions about LARCs are dispelled based on current evidence to increase the uptake especially among Nigerian women.\nWomen from poor households (lowest and second wealth quintiles) subscribed less to the different LARC methods compared to women from middle and wealthy households (middle, fourth and highest wealth quintiles) (Bolarinwa and Olagunju 2020; Ijarotimi et al. 2015; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Women aged 25 years and above were more likely to use a LARC method compared to women aged 15–24 years. Additionally, women who had 1–4 children subscribed further to LARC methods as opposed to women with no children.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Percent distribution of long-acting reversible contraception use by state in 2018\n\n\nDepo Provera® and Noristerat® were the most commonly used brands of Injectables (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Depo Provera® was largely used by women in the South-East and North-West zones, while Noristerat® was primarily used by women in the North-East. Notably, Depo Provera was the brand of choice for women in the lowest, second and fourth wealth quintile, who had either secondary, primary or no education. Conversely, the use of Noristerat® increased with educational attainment and wealth status. Over time, the use of Implants, particularly Implanon® and Jadelle® became popular (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Tunau et al. 2019). It seems that Implants have slowly replaced IUDs which were commonly used earlier. Highly educated women preferred Implants and had higher odds of using them the less educated counterparts. The plausible motive for this preference maybe the increased capacity to manage information correctly by educated women and awareness of the associated advantages of using Implants education provides (Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020). Non-literate women appeared to be suspicious of new methods and therefore shunned the method (Mutihir and Duru 2008). Specifically, young Nigerian women with desire for future fertility formed significant proportion of Implanon® acceptors (Roberts et al. 2015). Copper T, Depo Provera®, Noristerat® and Implanon® were the most popular brands of LARCs among female students (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012).\nIUDs are least commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Religious constraints seem to be the major propeller behind this; Muslim women while not considering family planning as un-Islamic, often view the insertion of an external object into their body to be sacrilegious (Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984). Although still used in other regions in Nigeria, IUDs are gradually losing favor in the South-Western region (Ameh and Sule 2007; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). The need for their husband’s consent maybe one of the primary reasons for the general decline in the application of IUDs. The thread from the IUDs often give women away when using them without their husband’s consent (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). Married women were more likely to use IUDs than singles, as most singles opt for other forms of contraception (E. C. Ezugwu et al. 2020).\nAlthough some women were not current users, they indicated interest in using Injectables and IUDs in the future (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). The proportion of Nigerian women who were non-users, but intend to use a modern method of contraception (such as LARCs) in the future was lowest in the North-East. This was the same for uneducated women living in rural areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Knowledge of this is crucial in order to meet the rising demand for LARCs by Nigerian women. These statistics confirm that demand generation will be a critical component of meeting the national contraceptive prevalence goal (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014).\nThe acceptance and use of LARCs was largely dependent on the attitude of women (Aduloju et al. 2021). Women’s attitude (positive or negative) towards LARCs was primarily determined by their level of education and number of surviving children (especially sons). Improvement in health, maintenance of a smaller family size and the fact that it made life more comfortable steered a positive attitude in women which made them four times more likely to use LARCs (Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015). Some women frowned at LARCs because they viewed regulating their fertility as an unhealthy immoral behavior which is an affront to the God-given blessing of fertility (Renne 1997; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ukaegbu 1977). Another contributing factor to the attitude of the women to LARCs was the viewpoint of health workers. For instance, although family planning and health workers may promote the use of LARCs like IUDs, some do so with reservations, advising women not to use IUDs if they have not had children before (Renne 1997)."

    "text": "3.4 Sources, availability, and accessibility of LARCs\nNigerian women seek long-acting reversible contraception from both public and private sectors (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). Government hospitals, government health centers and family planning clinics were major public health outlets for LARCs. LARCs such as IUDs, Implants, and Injectables were primarily sourced from the public sector because they require trained service delivery While family/private hospital/clinics and private pharmacies, popularly called “chemist shops” were popular private sector outlets (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015 ; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). The ease of accessing LARCs, proximity of service providers and level of confidentiality offered by service providers were key considerations in choosing where to get LARCs, given that some women used LARCs without their husband’s knowledge or approval (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013). Patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops being the most proximate and accessible providers were the major sources of LARCs that do not require trained medical services.\nReligion and denomination also influenced the source of purchase. Reported that while Roman Catholics purchase LARCs chiefly from patent medicine shops, the majority of other Christians procure theirs from general hospitals (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). The patronage of patent medicine shops by Catholics maybe associated with a religious objection to the use of modern contraceptive methods and the desire to keep their purchase of LARCs “confidential.” Similarly, Muslims patronized patent medicine shops more frequently, also due to reported high disapproval by of contraceptives (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005).\n\n\n\nPercent distribution of users of LARC methods age 15-49 by source.\nData from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018SourcesIntrauterine devices (%)Injectables (%)Implants (%)Public sectorGovernment hospital40.925.939.4Government health centre35.245.547.4Other public sector sources3.03.06.0Private sectorPrivate hospitals or clinics16.97.15.0Private pharmacy or stores0.812.80.4Other private sector sources3.35.61.8\n\n\nThere were geographical differences in accessing LARCs.

In contrast, rural dwellers got theirs mostly from patent medicine dealers (Onwujekwe et al. 2013), probably due to the proximity of these patent medicine shops and high cost transportation from rural to urban regions where bigger health facilities are located. This trend of the patent medicine shops being the most popular source of LARCs in rural regions is worrisome, since most of the patent medicine dealers are untrained (Monjok et al. 2010)\nMost women held the opinion that LARCs were not easily accessible (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). However, the proportion of women who thought that LARCs were not readily accessible decreased consistently with increase in educational status and residence in urban areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, one can infer that with exposure to education, women become well informed on the various means of accessing LARCs and are financially capable of purchasing them.\nAlthough a good number of Nigerian women desire them (The RESPOND Project 2013), there are certain barriers to accessing the wide variety of LARCs available. First, is the reduced availability of LARCs in certain family planning clinics (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005; The RESPOND Project 2013). The RESPOND project, reported feedback by one of the service providers where she buttressed this challenge:\n“..Sometimes we run out of stock but not too frequently; when that happens, I will go into the market to get some so that we will have the methods, because we are mindful of our clients’ appointment dates…. I used to tell the community that the IUD is now costly because we used to get it from black market in Makurdi…” (The RESPOND Project 2013)\n—Service provider, Adikpo, Benue State, Nigeria\nThe lack of basic supplies and equipment most often lead providers to charge unauthorized fees that some women cannot afford or request clients to purchase LARC supplies from the black market notorious for its uncertain quality (The RESPOND Project 2013). Second, some family planning clinics are in a poor state of repair, and many had either no or only intermittent electricity all of which discourages women (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nThe third barrier to accessing LARCs is the shortage of skilled providers to deliver LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). For instance, although the policy that permits Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to deliver Injectables was approved in 2012, only few CHEWs have received formal training on how to deliver the method properly (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Regarding other LARCs, Implants were introduced on a larger scale in the public sector only in 2006, and it is plausible that many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public system (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Many experienced Family Planning (FP) providers cited the lack of continuing education and training as the reason for the rather reduced skill set in administering LARCs, pointing to the 1980s as the last time that large-scale FP training efforts were in place (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014)."

    "text": "3.5 Effectiveness and safety profile of LARCs\nGenerally, LARCs were found to be a highly effective method of birth control, with several studies reporting no accidental pregnancies (Pearl index= 0) (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Aisien 2007; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Balogun et al. 2014; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Farr et al. 1996; Ladipo et al. 1993; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; Roberts et al. 2015). While there were a few reports of unintended pregnancies, the failure rate was very minimal, ranging from 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Although a relatively high failure rate of 3.7 percent was reported among IUD users in Abia State (Chigbu et al. 2010), unexpected pregnancy was observed in just one out of the 27 IUD users. Larger studies, however, revealed that IUDs, particularly Copper T-380A, were effective in over 99 percent of users (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; Fakeye 1991; Farr et al. 1996; Obi and Anya 2000). Similar high rates were found among users of progesterone-only injectables, notably Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Chigbu et al. 2010; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), and contraceptive subdermal implants, such as Implanon® (Balogun et al. 2014; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2015) Jadelle® (Enyindah and Kasso 2011) and Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ladipo et al. 1993; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010). A study in Jos reported one failure (3.3 percent) among 30 women who requested for and had Implanon® rods removed (Mutihir and Nyango 2010). However, this failure was due to inadvertent insertion of the implant during pregnancy.\nWhile LARCs were generally reported to be safe, the chief complaints were menstrual abnormalities (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Farr et al. 1996; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006; Obi and Anya 2000; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009; Roberts et al. 2015). Secondary amenorrhea was the most prevalent menstrual disturbance among women using progesterone-only injectables (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008) and reported to a lesser extent by users of IUDs (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and subdermal implants (Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Roberts et al. 2015). One study in Enugu, however, reported amenorrhea as the main side effect experienced by Jadelle® users (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Other menstrual disturbances associated with the use of LARCs include irregular bleeding, heavy/prolonged bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Also frequently reported complaints were lower abdominal pain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Aisien 2007; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and vaginal discharge. Breast pain was also reported with the use of implants (Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014). There were also considerable cases of weight gain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and a far lesser proportion of weight loss (Chigbu et al. 2010; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) among women using contraceptive injectables. Interestingly, there were a few reports of weight gain in users of IUDs and Implant, with one study in Jos reporting an average weight gain of 2.6kg among users of Copper T-380A (Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006). Meanwhile, Sagay et al. suggested that Norplant tends to prolong PR and QRS electrocardiogram intervals (Sagay et al. 2008). Similarly, hypertension was associated with the use of injectables (Akadri and Odelola 2017; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010), though report. Expulsion and missing IUDs were also reported in a few studies (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Obi and Anya 2000; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009)."

    "text": "3.6 Enablers and barriers to adoption of LARCs\nLack of knowledge, not being married, fear of the procedure, dislike of foreign body, inability to access LARCs, husband’s objection, fear of side effects/complications, fear of infertility, need for further counselling, high cost of LARCs, preference for natural methods, lack of knowledge on provider centers, inadequate information on the benefits of LARCs, conﬂicts with their religious and cultural beliefs were the major reasons given by the women for not using LARCs (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Konje et al. 1998; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977). In their study, Eke and Alabi-Isama (2011) reported that most adolescent females thought that LARCs should not be used by unmarried women.Other barriers to the use of LARCs include cultural bias (certain cultures are highly supportive of large family size), myths and misconceptions about LARCs, gender inequity, religious beliefs, fear of infection and reduction/loss of libido (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977).\nShortage of skilled providers to deliver available LARC services is a major barrier to the uptake of LARCs. As stated earlier, only few approved CHEWs have actually received formal training on delivering injectables (i.e., providing the necessary counselling, screening for pregnancy, and delivering the actual injection) [29]. In the North, women rely on CHEWs with at least two years of post-secondary school education as the primary point of care (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). In addition to their primary responsibility in delivering LARCs, these CHEWs often function as the sole staff members of Primary Health Care Centers, providing all the care in the community and sometimes delivering services for which they are not properly trained (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). As at October 2018, 65 percent of Nigerian health facilities have a LARC-trained service provider (Bietsch, Williamson, and Reeves 2020). But only 36 percent of these facilities provided LARCs to women at the same period. This shortage maybe because many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public sector or that commodities, tool and job aids for delivering services are unavailable (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013, 2020).\nSome studies indicated that many service providers contributed to barriers to uptake by restricting access, based on their personal cultural/social norms or client’s personal characteristics (i.e. age, parity, and marital status) (Camara et al. 2017; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). A 2017 study which reviewed restrictions to contraceptive access imposed by service providers (nurses/midwives, patent and proprietary medicine vendors, CHEWs and pharmacists), showed that service preferences were given to clients who were married or older than 24yrs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). Similarly, the performance monitoring for action (PMA) 2020’s Adolescents and Young Adults Health Brief indicated that unmarried individuals might be able to services for male condoms and emergency contraceptives – but are less likely to access same for LARCs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). As a result, unmarried individuals might choose not to use LARCs or opt for methods that are more likely accessible but less effective (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). The unavailability of adequate youth-friendly Family Planning service points may be the biggest factor in preventing adolescents from accessing LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother salient barrier to the uptake of LARCs which has most often been over-looked is the poor integration of family planning services (including LARCs) with maternal and new-born health, childhood immunization, nutrition programmes and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Although during pregnancy, women may not actively seek FP information or services, but they often engage proactively with the healthcare system during antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and ﬁrst year infant immunizations (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These contact points offer valuable and reliable opportunities for healthcare providers to educate the women on LARC services. Some of the challenges of integration of FP with Maternal and Newborn & Child Health (MNCH) include resistance within the separate health programme responsible for FP and Maternal and Child Health services, facility or community-based workers who are not trained or have inadequate staff time to address both MNCH and FP needs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nIncreased stock-outs of commodities due to unavailability or poor quality of actual consumption data to determine the true commodity need, delays in approving the supply plan to commence procurement, poorly implemented annual supply plans and irregular last mile distribution mostly due to lack of funding, limits the provision of quality LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFear of side effects—real or perceived—is another key barrier hindering the use of LARCs. For example, some women fear that some methods cause excessive bleeding and infertility (Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; The RESPOND Project 2013; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002). There were common beliefs that if a woman does not give birth to all the children in her womb, she may develop cancer (The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Another commonly held opinion is that a couple should not use any family planning methods early in their childbearing years, to avoid infertility. Some men fear that women become promiscuous when they practice family planning (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nLack of support from the husband not only hinders initial contraceptive use but may also lead to pre- mature termination of use of a long-acting method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013). To resolve this and achieve their birth-limiting goals, some women use contraceptive methods covertly, although such behavior may result in serious marital disharmony if the husband learns of it (The RESPOND Project 2013).Most women thought that negotiating and deciding with their husbands prior the use of any LARC method was necessary (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). But in reality, men alone played the dominant role in women’s decision to adopt long-acting reversible contraception and in the choice of method (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; The RESPOND Project 2013). The dominant role of men affected the use of LARCs because men generally demonstrated less favorable attitudes toward family planning than women and were less knowledgeable about LARCs (The RESPOND Project 2013). Hence, a woman’s ability to control her fertility and her choice of long-acting reversible contraception were partly determined by her empowerment status and self-image (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). A woman who is unable to control her life may be less likely to feel she can make and carry out decisions about her fertility (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004)."

    "section": "3.7 LARCs discontinuation prevalence and associated factors",
    "text": "3.7 LARCs discontinuation prevalence and associated factors\nThe discontinuation rate varied considerably across the different LARCs types and with the duration of usage. Unsurprisingly, there was an increase in discontinuation rates over time, particularly for injectables which typically require two-monthly or three-monthly administration. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation at 12 months of use was highest among women using DMPA injectables, ranging from 50 percent to 62 percent (Chigbu et al. 2010; Fakeye 1991; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ogedengbe et al. 1987). However, in Osogbo a slightly lower rate of 22.4 percent was observed (A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012). Interestingly, an Enugu study documented a low discontinuation rate (12.8 percent) even at 36 months (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Compared to injectables, implants and IUDs had better continuity owing to their longer life span. The 12-month discontinuation rate for IUDs was 10%-22% (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Fakeye 1991; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; van Dierendonck et al. 1992), while those for implants were 1-8 percent for Implanon® (Ezegwui et al. 2011; Mutihir and Duru 2008)and 5.4-9.8% for Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Fakeye 1991). Jadelle®, a relatively new contraceptive implant in Nigeria, had no discontinuations among users in Rivers State (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Ogedengbe et al. (1987), however, observed comparable discontinuation rates between IUDs (45.6%) and Injectables (50.2%). For Norplant®, after 36 months, approximately 11-18% of users had discontinued use (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998).\nSide effects/health concerns were the primary reason for discontinuing LARCs. Common side effects like changes in menstrual cycle, irregular spotting of blood through the vagina and amenorrhea have been associated to the use of progestogen-only methods (Okafor 2018). To reduce the occurrence of side-effects and promote use, LARCs should be selected based on informed decisions. This is an important principle in the delivery of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). Women using LARCs should also be counseled, so they can cope easily with side effects, to avoid dissatisfactions and unnecessary discontinuations of the methods (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nThe most frequently reported reasons for discontinuing LARCs were the desire for pregnancy (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Ogedengbe et al. 1987; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008; van Dierendonck et al. 1992) and menstrual side effects (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998). Abnormal menstruation, particularly amenorrhea, was a commonly cited reason by users of contraceptive injectable (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012). Spousal factors such as husband’s objection and husband’s deaths were also linked with discontinuation (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). Expulsion of contraceptive devices was also reported among IUD users (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Fakeye 1991; Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ogedengbe et al. 1987)."

    "section": "3.8 Policy environment on LARCs in Nigeria",
    "text": "3.8 Policy environment on LARCs in Nigeria\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGON) have made considerably good strides in creating an enabling environment for LARCs to thrive (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). For instance, certain positive policy reforms have occurred, notably the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy which allows CHEWs to administer Injectables (they are still restricted from providing IUDs and implants) (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014, 2020). Additional reforms include making LARCs free in public-sector clinics and reforming the nurse/midwife training curriculum to make it proficiency-based and supported by rigorous supervision (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Shelton and Finkle 2016). These policy reforms yielded some success in the uptake of LARCs. For instance, between 2008 and 2013, the use of Implants increased from 0.4 to 3.4 percent (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Nigeria’s Family Planning Effort (FPE) ratings in 2014 also indicate notable progress in Policies and Access (Avenir Health 2016). Nevertheless, the country’s FPE scores, are still very low compared to other countries in the region (Avenir Health 2016). Hence, intensive efforts are needed to significantly improve Nigeria’s FP policy and program environment (Avenir Health 2016).\nCurrently, there are at least four plans with Family Planning/Reproductive Health goals associated with them. These are the National LARC Strategy, the Reproductive Health Commodity Strategy, the National Strategic Health Development Plan, and the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) Strategy (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Other important policies include the National Youth Policy 2009, Gender Policy 2008, National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria 2007, and the National School Health Policy 2006. The School Health Policy provides the framework for implementing the national school health program (Cortez et al. 2015).\nAdditionally, the FGON committed to further creating an enabling environment for family planning activities (including LARCs). This commitment was buttressed in the following actions: revitalizing its commitment in the 2017 Summit on Family Planning, developing a national guideline to scale-up private providers’ access to government’s free FP commodities, reviewing the National Reproductive Health Policy and The Reproductive Health Strategic Framework and developing an accelerated introduction and scale-up plan for the Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to increase access to injectable contraceptives (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nHowever, there are still some gaps in some of the policies, especially pertaining access to family planning services and rights to adolescents and youths (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Currently, reproductive health policies do not indicate unrestricted access to family planning (including LARCs) services for youths, without provider discretion, parental or spousal consent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). . Most policies and national documents are vague on the age of consent for youths (i.e. age of consent) [Power et al., 2021]. These documents do not explicitly state the youth’s legal right to freely and independently access a full range of contraceptive services, including LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Hence, health providers choosing to provide service to adolescents and youth are not protected by any policy statement that legally authorizes health providers to offer contraceptive services to this age group (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFurthermore, the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy does not adequately recognize the large resource pool of providers within the healthcare system that can offer some LARC services (e.g., injectables) These healthcare providers include; the Junior Community Health Extension Worker (JCHEWs), Community Pharmacists, Community Midwives and PPMVs. Inclusion of these providers in the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy is vital as these cadre could play important roles in providing LARCs to women since in a large proportion of rural facilities, they may be the only available healthcare providers (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother policy challenge is the poor translation of existing policies to action (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). There is a recurrent challenge of timely and effective implementation of most policies/guidelines (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). This is especially so because the autonomy of adoption and implementation of policies made by the Federal Ministry of Health falls on the State Ministry of Health. For example, since the approval of the Task Shifting Policy in 2012, as at 2019, 13 states are yet to begin domestication (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Likewise, for the National FP Blueprint, 14 states are yet to domesticate the plan to state level costed implementation plans since its launch in 2014 (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\n\nTable 1: Summary of policy challenges |——–|——–|——–|——————————————-|——–| | | | | | | | | S/N | | Policy Challenges | | | | | | | | | | 1. | | Inadequate policies supporting Adolescent and Youth Family Planning | | | | | | | | | | 2. | | Ambiguities in existing Family Planning policies (especially around adolescent and youth | | | | | | | | | | 3. | | Poor translation of existing policies to action | | | | | | | |\nSource: Nigeria Family Planning Blue Print (2020-2024), 2020."

    "text": "3.9 Programs and initiatives to increase LARCs uptake\nSeveral programs and initiatives have been launched to support the government’s efforts to increase uptake of LARCs and utmostly achieve the national family planning goals of a modern contraceptive prevalence of 27 percent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These programs have strikingly increased the provision of LARCs in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016). The most recent includes:\n· The Marie Stopes Nigeria “BlueStar” social franchising program 2012: This supports more than 300 private-sector providers, particularly in the South, of whom about 70% are midwives. The midwives in turn provided a notably large number of women—more than 65,000—with contraception, especially implants, in 2015.\n· The Society for Family Health’s “Healthy Family Network social franchising program, with more than 300 service providers, has likewise been successful, although more with the IUDs.\n· DKT International also launched a program that gives support to private providers, particularly in the South. Its model consists primarily of marketing contraceptive products to providers and distributors, without the networking and other components of social franchising. LARC sales in 2015 was at more than 100,000 which is striking.\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria commenced a program focused on deploying “mobile outreach” teams in the North. These mobile outreaches typically occur in collaboration with the public sector and in public-sector sites. Remarkably, with only 8 outreach teams, they provided about 63,000 clients with LARCs in 2015, primarily implants\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria also began the Family Health Plus initiative in 2014. It works with public-sector providers at the state level, now expanded to 20 states, emphasizing training, supportive supervision, and supply chain. Again, providing LARCs to more than 250,000 clients in 2015.\nMore than 550,000 women have received LARCs from just these 5 initiatives, representing over 2% of married women of reproductive age and 1.5% of all women of reproductive age in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nLARCs engender high rates of satisfaction and continuation, the sustained cumulative effect of these programs over a period of time would be substantial. For instance, between 2014 and 2015, the share of overall modern contraceptive use for implants in Kaduna state (where Family Health Plus, Healthy Family Network, Marie Stopes Nigeria mobile outreach, and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative as well as others) are all active, increased from 16 percent to 28 percent [Nigeria - Kaduna and Lagos Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Survey, Round 2 2015 | GHDx, n.d.).\nFurthermore, these programs have provided proof for many vague concepts about LARC uptake in Nigeria. First, it can now be firmly stated that LARCs are highly acceptable for Nigerian women desiring contraception (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Second, promoting equity by providing LARC services in very low-income as well as higher-income clients is highly efficient (Shelton and Finkle 2016). A precedent, indicates that 75 percent, 53 percent, and 49 percent of Marie Stopes Nigeria’s mobile outreach, Family Health Plus, and social franchising clients, respectively, were from households living on less than US$2.50 per day (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Third, success is attainable in every geographical zone in Nigeria. While it is generally held that the more conservative North is highly resistant to family planning, these projects—notably, mobile outreach and the Family Health Plus public-sector support project demonstrate that with concerted efforts, success can be achieved in the North as well (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Fourth, the Family Health Plus program showed that despite the public sector’s reputation as a weak service delivery platform, when the private sector works closely with the government, public-sector service delivery on LARCs can be successful (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nTable 2: Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods by Selected Program Initiatives, Nigeria, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\nImplants\nIUDs\nTotal\n\n\nBlue Star (Marie Stopes Nigeria\n51,643\n13,811\n65,454\n\n\nHealthy Family Network (SFH)\n20,273\n53,900\n74,173\n\n\nDKT International sales\n15,967\n87,600\n103,567\n\n\nMobile outreaches (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n53,786\n9,200\n62,986\n\n\nFamily Health Plus (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n222,705\n29,686\n252,391\n\n\nTotal\n364,374\n194,197\n558,571\n\n\n\nSource: For Marie Stopes Nigeria - personal communication with Anna Mackay; Deputy Director of SIFPO Project for Marie Stopes International; for SFH - personal communication with Peter Entonu, (Associate Director of Social Franchise Unit); for DKT, sales report from December 2015.\nIn addition to the programs described above, a number of other worthwhile initiatives are ongoing in Nigeria, including traditional social marketing and clinic-based public-sector and NGO service (Shelton and Finkle 2016)."

    "text": "2.1 Data Sources\nWe used data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 for this study [1–3,20]. The survey is a nationally representative survey of Nigerian households. Women aged 15-49 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors who spent the previous night in the household. A total of 7,620; 33,385; 38,948 and 41,821 women aged 15-49 were interviewed in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 surveys. The survey collected various information from women including fertility preference, sexual activity, and reproductive history, alongside background characteristics.\nThe key background variables considered in this study were percentage of women with secondary education or above, percentage of women working in the labour force, percentage of women living in urban residence, percentage of women in different geographical zones. The TFR was calculated from births and exposure during the three years (36 months) prior to each woman’s month of interview. The nominal date of a TFR is the year of the survey, but the reference period is prior to that. The reference period for the proximate determinants is also prior to the date of interview except for contraception, which is based on current contraceptive use. In terms of synchronization, the link between fertility and contraception is problematic. For individual women, contraception affects subsequent fertility, but in the data, fertility s measured for an earlier date than contraception.\nFor the estimation of index of abortion, we used the total abortion rate (TAR) reported in a survey by Guttmacher Institute [21]. The survey estimated the TAR using data on delivery of abortion and post-abortion care services from a nationally representative sample of 772 health facilities in 2012. The TAR obtained from his study was kept constant for all years of the analysis – 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018."

    "section": "2.2 Data analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Data analysis\nThis study examines the contributions of biological and behavioural determinants to fertility change, as well as the effects of the socio-economic and geographic factors through which the determinants exert their influence. Statistical analyses for inputs in the model were performed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) and confirmed with published DHS reports for inputs available in the reports. The proximate determinants of fertility, potential fertility and background variables were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. In the following section we present detailed analysis of fertility differentials that quantifies the negative and positive effects of each of the socio-economic and geographic factors on fertility through various intermediate fertility variables.\n\n2.2.1 Proximate determinants: The Bongaart’s Model\nWe used a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Each of the determinants is assumed to independently inhibit fertility. In the original model, Bongarts identified the following: an index for marriage, contraception, abortion and post-partum infecundity and expressed TFR as the product of the four indices together with total fecundity (TF) - the average number of live births expected among women during their entire lifetime, [9].\n\\[\nTFR = C_m\\:*\\:C_{i}\\:*\\:C_{c}\\:*\\:C_{a}\\:*\\:TF\n\\]\nwhere, TFR is the total fertility rate, Cm is the index of proportion married, Ci is the index of post-partum infecundability, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Cc is the index of contraception. The indices only take values between 0 and 1. If the corresponding index is of no fertility inhibition effect, the index equals 1; an index of 0 which is not empirically proven, indicates total inhibition effect [9].\nA revision of this model attempted to account for overlaps between the determinants, specifically between postpartum amenorrhea and contraceptive use [10]. The revised framework used for this study includes five intermediate fertility variables; proportion sexually exposed, postpartum infecundability, contraception, induced abortion, and sterility which are key direct determinants of fertility. From the original model, the index of marriage was revised to include women who have been in a sexual union in the last month, use contraceptives, are pregnant or post-partum infecundable. This index was renamed index of sexual exposure [10]. The index of post-partum infecundability was modified to post-partum insusceptibility including both median duration of post-partum amenorrhea and post-partum abstinence. The index of abortion was revised by multiplying contraceptive prevalence with average use effectiveness of contraception [10].\nThe index of sterility was modified from proportion of women 45-49 years old who had no live births to the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund. Index of contraception was revised to the proportion of sexually active fecund women using contraceptives that do not overlap with those experiencing postpartum amenorrhea and the average effectiveness of contraception [10]. The revised equation relating the total fertility rate to the proximate determinants used in this study is expressed as:\n\\[\nTFR=PF\\:*\\:C_{x}\\:*\\:C_{u}\\:*C_{a}\\:*C_{i}\\:*C_{f}\\:\n\\]\nWhere TFR is the total fertility rate, PF is the potential fertility, Cx represents the index of sexual exposure, Cu is the index of contraception, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Ci is the index of postpartum insusceptibility and Cf represents the index of sterility. Estimates from empirical data showed an average potential fertility of 21 (18-24) births per woman for the 35-year reproductive period from age 15 to 49 years [10]. Nonetheless, estimates of PF may exceed its theoretical limits because of a large error term in the proximate determinants’ framework, attributed in a large part to the effects of unmeasured factors exogenous to the framework [22].\n\n\n2.2.2 The index of sexual exposure (Cx)\nThe index of sexual exposure expresses the reduction in fertility caused by women’s not being sexually active throughout their entire reproductive period. The index is calculated as:\n\\[\nC_x=\\:s\n\\]\nwhere s is the proportion of women aged 15-49 who are sexually active (women who either are pregnant, report sex in the last month, use contraception, or are postpartum infecundable). The index of sexual exposure, Cx, equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are sexually active during the entire reproductive period and 0 in the absence of such.\n\n\n2.2.3 The index of contraception (Cc)\nThis considers both the level of contraceptive prevalence and the average effectiveness of contraceptive methods used. It is estimated as:\n\\[\nC_c=\\:1\\:-\\:1.08ue\n\\]\nwhere u is the proportion of women in the reproductive ages who are currently using contraception among those sexually active, excluding exclude those infecund and postpartum amenorrhic within 6 months after birth; and e is the average of use-effectiveness of contraception as practiced in the population. Estimates of the method-specific effectiveness are: sterilization (0.995), pill (0.930), injectable (0.970), implant (0.999), intra-uterine device (0.993), male condom (0.870), and other modern methods (0.800) [23].\n\n\n2.2.4 The index of sexual abortion (Ca)\nThe index of abortion is the proportion by which the PF is reduced due to induced abortion. Births averted per induced abortion are related to contraceptive use [22]. The index of abortion is defined as the ratio of the observed TFR to the estimated TFR without induced abortion, and declines with increasing incidence of induced abortion [10]. This index is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nC_a=\\frac{TFR}{TFR\\:+\\:0.4\\:*\\:(1\\:+\\:u)\\:*\\:TAR}\n\\]\nwhere TFR is the total fertility rate, u represents the proportion protected by contraception among women who have an induced abortion and TAR is the total abortion rate which is the average number of induced abortions per married or in-union woman at the end of the reproductive period if induced abortions remain at prevailing levels. The index of induced abortion equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Reliable data on the total abortion rate for all years is not available. We assumed abortion rates prevailing in 2012 [21], will remain constant throughout 2018.\n\n\n2.2.5 The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci)\nThe index of postpartum infecundability represents the reduced risk of exposure to conception immediately following a birth [24]. In the absence of any breastfeeding (and postpartum abstinence), the average birth interval is around 20 months, which includes four segments: a period of postpartum amenorrhea (1.5 months), the average waiting time to conception (7.5 months), time added by spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months) and 9 months of a full term pregnancy. The last three segments are assumed constant and sum up to 18.5 months. Postpartum amenorrhea is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. The index of postpartum infecundability is estimated by the ratio of the average birth interval where breastfeeding and abstinence are absent, and the length of a birth interval where the period of postpartum infecundability is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. It is estimated using the formula:\n\\[\nC_i\\:=\\:\\frac{20}{18.5\\:+\\:i}\n\\]\nwhere Ci = index of postpartum infecundability; and i = average duration of postpartum infecundability due to breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence. In the absence of breastfeeding and abstinence, i would be equal to 1.5, its minimum possible value, and Ci would equal 1. As the duration of postpartum infecundability increases, Ci declines and it would tend towards 0 if the duration of postpartum infecundability were to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n2.2.6 The index of sterility (Cs)\nCs measures the incidence of natural infertility and pathological sterility. This index expresses the total effect of infecundity because of a pathological condition. The net effect of pathological sterility would be the difference between the actual index and some base value that represents natural infecundity. The formula for measuring the index of sterility is represented as:\n\\[\nC_f~=\\:1\\:-\\:f\n\\]\nwhere f is defined as the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund."

    "text": "2.3 Background and institutional factors\nIn this study, we assessed the socio-economic or contextual characteristics that influence fertility through changes in the proximate determinants. These were the level of education, female participation in the workforce, wealth quintile, geopolitical regions and type of residence. Each of these factors has well established associations with fertility [25]. We examined fertility preferences through the ideal number of children and desire for more children. The DHS asks women with living children, “If you could go back to the time [when] you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” For women who are yet to give birth, the question is framed as “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019). We considered only numeric responses. The survey also asked women whether they wanted more children in addition to those they have, thus reflecting desire for further reproduction.\nThe study also tracked four indicators of women’s fertility preferences. The key indicators that reflect fertility-related international policy and program priorities include planning status for most recent birth in the past five years, percent of children born to mothers under age 18, percent of children born to mothers over age 34, and the median length of the birth interval (in months). We assessed the strength of Nigeria’s Family planning programs using the Family Planning Effort Index (FPEI) and National Composite Index on Family Planning (NCIFP). The FPE has been collected periodically since 1972, and provides results across four key components: policies, services, evaluation, and access [26]. The index was developed to measure the level of effort that goes into FP programs, and to track how these changes over time. The NCIPF measures the existence and implementation of family planning policies and program under five components: strategy, data, quality, equity, and accountability. It is built on the FPEIS framework [27]."

    "text": "2.4 Results\nThe indices of direct biological and behavioural determinants of fertility from Bongaarts models is shown in Table 1. The behavioural indices include index of sexual exposure (Cx), index of contraception (Cc)and index of abortion (Ca) while the index of sterility (Cs) is a biological determinant. Postpartum infecundability (Ci) is a function of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence. The duration of amenorrhea is a function of the normal length of amenorrhea after childbirth women which is due to breastfeeding practices. The duration of abstinence is entirely behavioural.\n\n\n\nEstimated Indices for Proximate Determinants of Fertility, DHS\n2003-2018YearCxCiCaCfCuPFSurvey TFRModel TFR20030.700.590.940.810.8521.005.655.6520080.700.620.940.820.8220.725.725.8020130.720.640.940.800.8119.485.505.9320180.680.640.940.800.8219.615.295.67Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2003-2018\n\n\nCi was the lowest among the indices in our study at 0.64 in the 2018 survey. This implies that postpartum infecundability is associated with reduction of potential fertility by 36% from its biological maximum. Delayed sexual exposure (Cx) inhibited fertility by 32% being the second most effective ferility reducing factor. The index of abortion was high at 0.94. Hence, abortion [28–30]. This index is therefore excluded from the discussions. The other reductions in PF occurred because of inability to bear children (Cf, 0.80) and effects from the use of contraceptive technologies (Cu, 0.82). The lowest contributor is the index of contraception, contributing to 18% reduction in PF. There were little changes during the period of the survey in the 5 indices.\nThe revised Bongaart’s model gave an estimated TFR of 5.67, which is 0.38 children higher than TFR measured by DHS survey in 2018 (5.29). The analysis arrived at similar values for 2003 (5.65 each). Any difference between these sets of TFRs may be due to underestimation in DHS samples, inaccuracies in the data, inexactitude in our estimation of the indices, or other factors left out of the model. Nevertheless, the model shows the relative contributions of the determinants, and enables us report variations between socio-economic and geographic groups, as well as changes over the years of the surveys 2003-2018.\nThe influence of the proximate determinants and their variability by these background factors are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2003 respectively. The study shows that for 2018, attainment of secondary education is associated with relatively low indices for sexual exposure (0.58) and contraception (0.62). Across the educational attainment levels, these two indices have an inverse relationship in all years of the survey. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability increases with additional educational attainment. This would reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Concerning disparity in place of residence and wealth, Cx was higher among rural residents in all years (rural - 0.74, urban - 061). This means sexual exposure inhibited fertility by 33.5% among rural residents, and 39% among city dwellers. On the contrary, the Ci was higher among urban residents (rural - 0.61, urban - 0.68). Contribution of sterility to reducing PF is not dependent on place of residence, as Cf in all years were within ±0.03 units. As expected, the index of contraception is higher in rural areas relative to urban population, reflecting a higher contraceptive use among sexually exposed female urban dwellers. There also are notable differences between women of different wealth quintiles. The values of the indices are lower for women in higher wealth quintiles, meaning a higher depression of fertility, with exception of Ci. The Ci increases progressively along the wealth quintiles (lowest - 0.56, second - 0.61, middle - 0.64, fourth - 0.68, highest - 0.75) in 2018, as well as across all the years of the survey.\nWorkforce participation is associated with a lower fertility in 2018, with no notable difference in preceding years. In the latest year of the survey, the estimated TFR among women in workforce was 5.22, compared to 5.93 in women without workforce participation. In 2013 however, the reverse was the case (in workforce - 5.76, not in workforce - 5.62) The differences were negligible in 2008 (in workforce – 5.93, not in workforce - 5.99), and 2003 (in workforce - 5.78, not in workforce - 5.74). In all years, the index of contraception contributed more to depression of fertility among those in workforce compared to those not active in workforce. In contrast, the index of marriage and index of sterility contributed more to fertility reduction among women of reproductive age not active in workforce.

The family planning effort index (FEPI) is based on the aggregate of four dimensions of family planning effort (policies, services, evaluation, and method access). Raw scores were converted to percentages and are reported. FEPI increased between 1972 and 1999, then reduced through 2009, before increasing to 41% in 2014. The increase in FEPI to its all-time highest in 1999 corresponds to the lowest survey TFR recorded in Nigeria, 5.11 in 1999 [31]. During this time, access to contraceptives was high at 70.3%, and evaluation of services rendered stood at 81.4% (see Supplementary Information). The FEPI has since been replaced by another measure, the National Composite Index on Family Planning, NCIFP (see Supplementary Information). The most recent NCIFP in 2017 assessed the strategy (score - 62.4%), data (65.5%), quality (62.0%), accountability (39.0%) and equity (58.0%) of family planning in Nigeria. On all measures, the scores in 2017 (composite index - 62.4%) were higher than those in 2014 (composite index - 49.5%).\n{fig-fp-effort-index}\nLastly, the study includes some outcome indicators. The state of planning for new births and incidence of births among the young and aged population are a reflection of policy priorities concerning reproductive options available to women. [25]. Among 12.2% of women aged 15-49 years with at least one child, the most recent birth was planned i.e. they wanted to have their last child at the time. There has been no notable increase in the median birth interval. The percentage of births to women less than 18 years of age has steadily reduced from 8.9% in 2003 to 6.0% in 2018. Overall, after an initial increase between 2003 and 2008, the percentage of births to women older than 34 years has remained relatively unchanged.\n\n\n\nSome Women Reproductive Options Outcome IndicatorsOutcome Indicator2003200820132018Proportion that planned most recent birth (%)16.711.99.812.2Median birth intervals (in months)31.231.331.730.9Proportion of births to women &lt;18 years (%)8.97.37.16.0Proportion of births to women &gt;34 years (%)14.415.315.315.0"

    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nThis study used the revised Bongaart’s model to show contributions of the biological and behavioural determinants of fertility in Nigeria, and the effects of selected socio-economic and geographical variables. We found that postpartum infecundability consistently had the strongest inhibitory effect on fertility rates from 2003 to 2018, closely followed by delayed sexual exposure and sterility. In contrast, abortion had the least inhibitory effect, proceeded by contraception use. Regarding socio-economic and geographical correlates, our study shows that the inhibitory effect of contraception, abortion, delayed sexual exposure were more evident among highly educated and rich women residing in urban areas of Southern Nigeria. Additionally, the recent index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate an increase in family planning program efforts from 2014 to 2017. We also found that fertility levels were highest in the Northwest and lowest in Southwest, and this pattern was consistent from 2003 to 2018.\nOne of the most significant findings in our study was that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. A plausible explanation for the dominant inhibiting effect of postpartum infecundability could be the effect of prolonged breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea. There is a clear association between the duration and intensity of breastfeeding, the length of postpartum amenorrhea, and postpartum infecundability. For instance, [24] demonstrated that the risk of conception increases in the absence of breastfeeding after postpartum menstruation resumes. Similar studies conducted in Nigeria [32] and other sub-Saharan African countries including Zambia [13], Malawi [33] and Ethopia [8], have also indicated that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. Recognizing the impact of postpartum infecundability on fertility rates has key policy implications for addressing Nigeria’s high fertility rates. Analysis of the effect of education and wealth on postpartum infecundability highlighted a positive correlation between postpartum infecundability and additional educational attainment. This is similar to findings by [34], and reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Asides postpartum infecundability, delayed sexual exposure and sterility were the major contributors to the reduced fertility levels in Nigeria. The contribution of delayed sexual exposure to reduced TFRs in the Southern regions reflects a higher awareness and uptake of contraception, as well as the postponement of the age of first marriage in the Southern region (usually due to education) compared to the Northern region [35].\nAbortion and contraception had the least inhibitory effects on fertility. Unlike previous studies on the proximate determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa [13,36], we were able to estimate the index of abortion in this study. The reduced inhibitory effect of abortion may be attributed to its illegal status in Nigeria. Abortion is only allowed when it is necessary to save a woman’s life. [21]. Sociocultural and religious norms surrounding induced abortion in Nigeria could also contribute to its diminished impact on fertility rates [21]. Increased contraceptive intake is typically associated with reduced fertility rates [37]. As a result, we initially hypothesized that the intensified national family planning efforts would result in a higher inhibitory effect of contraception on fertility rates. However, our study showed that the use of contraception only accounted for only 18% in fertility reduction in 2018. Similar to our finding, a previous study conducted in Uganda [38] also found that contraception had the least inhibitory effect on fertility. Both findings contrasts the study by Mahjabeen and Khan [34] who found that contraception had the highest impact on reducing fertility, accounting for 51% of the decrease in TFR in Zambia. Potential reasons for the high inhibitory effect of contraception in Zambia include cultural acceptance and availability of contraception, education and awareness about family planning, and government policies and programs promoting contraception use.\nThe relationship between socio-economic and geographical correlates can be clearly seen in this study. We found that the 5 proximate determinants considered in this study varied with education, wealth, workforce participation and residence. Sexual exposure had a higher inhibitory effect on rural residents than urban residents, probably due to factors such as limited access to family planning services, lower socioeconomic development, cultural and religious beliefs, and reduced health information and awareness. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve access to contraception, address socioeconomic challenges, provide health education, and consider cultural and religious contexts in rural communities. Contraception use had a higher inhibitory effect on fertility in urban residents compared to rural residents. One reason could be that urban women are more likely to use contraceptives than are rural women. Another reason could be that women who are highly educated, and lived in urban regions tend to delay marriage and are more likely to use modern methods of contraception [39]. Postpartum infecundability had lesser inhibitory effects on highly educated, rich urban women. This may be correlated with shorter durations of breastfeeding probably due to the intense work schedules common in urban areas.\nThe index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate Nigeria’s significant strides in improving access to family planning services, and reducing the unmet need for contraception (i.e., a larger proportion of individuals who desire to use contraception have access to it). However, it also suggests that providing accessible reproductive options is not currently a primary policy focus in Nigeria. There is need for continued investment and implementation of effective family planning programs to improve program scores, sustain positive implications and achieve the sustainable development goals.\nA major limitation of this study is the reliance on secondary data collected using a cross sectional design study design. Additionally, since the information collected in this study was self-reported, there is risk of responder bias due to cultural beliefs and attitude towards fertility issues. For instance, women tend to omit some of the children they have given birth to, particularly those living in other households and those who have died [40]. Nonetheless, a key strength in our study is that we were able to expand our model to include key contextual factors that affect fertility such as socio-economic status and geographical location that can also significantly influence fertility."

Therefore, we suggest policies that prioritize postpartum health support, raise awareness about postpartum infecundability and its implications for fertility rates, and promote breastfeeding initiatives and family planning programs. These policies should be designed to extend the duration of infecundability, thereby contributing to the reduction of TFRs in Nigeria. We recommend communication and messaging around family planning all require financial resources. It is critical that enough funds are provided to support these efforts.These approaches ought to be specific to the different geopolitical zones since There are varying behavioural and proximate determinants unique to these regions.

    "title": "Labour Absorption and Employment Elasticities in Nigeria",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe ultimate goal of every nation is the well-being of its citizens regardless of its economic, political and social settings. This is reflected by economic development which dwells on growth and distributions as well as their interconnections. A distinctive strength of the informal sector especially its Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) is the effective and efficient absorption of labour and growth in employment.\nLabour is an important factor that enables economic development through the production of goods and services and the satisfaction of individuals’ needs. Economic performance is a function of capital and labour. Economic indicators relating to employment, particularly those that evaluate a country’s ability to provide enough jobs for its people, can give you a lot of information about a country’s overall macroeconomic performance. Unemployment rates, employment-to-population ratios, and labour force participation rates are among the most generally discussed metrics along these lines. The employment intensity of growth or elasticity of employment with regard to output is another labour market indicator that indicates employment growth related to economic growth.\nFor a country like Nigeria, where unemployment rates keep rising and the population also increasing. It is important to understand the past and current employment and absorption capacity of the country as it can provide vital information that can be used for policymaking to curb unemployment.\nHence, it is of the essence that labour absorption and employment elasticities be studied. This analysis uses descriptive methods to analyze labour absorption and employment elasticities in Nigeria.\n\n\nLabour Absorption\nLabour absorption is the level at which the working population are engaged in economic activities at a particular period of time and the metric for labour absorption is “Labour Absorption Rate (LAR)” or “Employment to Population Ratio.”\nAccording to the ILO database, the employment-to-population ratio expresses the number of persons who are employed as a percentage of the total working-age population. In other words, it is the proportion of the working-age population aged 15-65 years that is employed. It measures the proportion of the working-age population that is employed (Ozili 2020)\nMathematically,\n\\[\n\\textrm{Employment To Population Ratio}=\\frac{\\textrm{total Employed}}{\\textrm{Working Age Population}} \\times 100\n\\]\nThe labour absorption rate (LAR) in Nigeria has been on a continual decrease since 2014 with a significant decrease in 2020 as shown in figure 1 below. This shows that the working-age population is growing more compared to the levels of employment (working-age population addition yearly is over a million while for employment is in thousands). The significant decrease in 2020 can be attributed to the pandemic when a lot of jobs were lost and the working-age population kept increasing (Ozili 2020; PwC 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Labour absorption rate in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\nDisaggregating LAR into full and part-time employment brings a better understanding of LAR as shown in figure 2 below. The fall in LAR for full-time employment followed the same pattern as the general LAR which is normal but interestingly part-time employment was on the increase with the exception of 2020, the pandemic year.\nThis is because, following the law governing demand and supply of labour, all things being equal “increase supply of labour leads to decrease in wages”. A decrease in wages implies a decrease in working hours hence increased part-time employment. Due to the increasing nature of the working population and employment increasing at a decreasing rate, the number of hours decreases as a reaction to decreasing in wages.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Labour absorption by employment type\n\n\nFurther, in the analysis, LAR was disaggregated by zone. The descriptive showed nothing out of the normal as shown in figure 3 below. LAR are highest in the two economic zones in Nigeria where the economic hub and the Federal capital territory are located. South-South and North West follow closely with South-South being the domain of oil which is the primary source of revenue for the country and Northwest housing Kano, the business capital in the north. The Northwest has the lowest LAR and this is due to insecurity coupled with the pandemic of 2020 which has shut down most economic activities even agriculture has been disrupted. People are gradually bringing back economic activities and leaving Internal Displaced Persons Camps (IDP camps) to being farming\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Labour absorption by geo-political zones in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Elasticity\nEmployment elasticity (EE) also called “Employment Intensity of Growth” is a measure of the percentage change in employment associated with a percentage point change in growth for a sector or total GDP. The employment elasticity indicates the ability of an economy to generate employment opportunities for its population as a percentage of its growth.\nEmployment is an important element of growth and development; it acts as a link between economic growth and poverty reduction. Employment elasticities are also frequently used to track industry potential for job creation and estimate future employment development.\nMathematically, EE is calculated in two ways;\n1.      The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) method: This method gives the “arc” employment elasticity, this is the elasticity of one variable in relation to another between two given points. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\ne = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nWhere L refers to employment, Y GDP and \\(\\Delta\\) percentage change. Change in GDP is essentially GDP growth rate.\n2.      The Regression approach: This on the other hand provides the “point” elasticity, this is the elasticity at a specific point on the curve. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\nln L = \\alpha + \\beta lnY\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\beta\\) serves as the employment elasticity. When the derivative is taken, we arrive at;\n\\[\ne = \\frac{dlnL}{dlnY} = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nIn a nutshell, EE examines how economic growth (output) and employment evolve together over time. Looking at the EE of Nigeria from 2011 to 2022, EE growth has not been stable as shown below in figure 4. Employment elasticity in 2012, 2016 and 2017 was negative. In 2016 there was a recession and in 2017, Nigeria was still trying to get back on its feet. During a recession, economic growth becomes negative and industries will have to lay off workers or cut wages in other to survive. By 2018, the economy was booming. This shows that a 1 per cent increase in growth led to a 0.5 per cent increase in employment.\nIn 2021 after the pandemic, the economy was recovering from the pandemic shocks and different job opportunities were springing forth which include Artificial intelligence and data analytics which were majorly remote and the barrier for location was eliminated (Jenq, Lain, and Vishwanath 2021; WEF 2020). This explains why the employment elasticity was 7.4 per cent meaning for every 1 per cent increase in growth, employment increased by 7.4 per cent.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Employment elasticity in Nigeria between 2010 and 2022. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is evident from the above data that Nigeria is not doing well when it comes to employment generation and absorbing its working population. A high working-age population implies availability of labour which is an advantage when utilize will boost economic growth substantially.  The continuous decrease in LAR means two things either the job creation level is not growing or the working-age population grows more than the level of employment creation, the latter seems to be most suitable. Another reason for the fall in LAR is the lack of skilled labour to be employed and the information asymmetry that exists in the labour market. Hence there is a need to encourage and build more vocational centers and improve the standard of education. To build an economy that has the capacity to absorb its labour, the quality and skills of workers need to be addressed because increased investment married with a skilled labour force will lead to economic growth and subsequently the creation of employment.\nAlso, EE figures indicate the existence of “jobless growth” which is a result of the slow pace of job creation in Nigeria. Jobless growth is a term used when there is continuous macroeconomic economic growth without a corresponding growth in job creation (PwC 2018). Major cause of jobless growth in Nigeria includes lack of diversification, poor economic restructuring, poor macroeconomic policies, e.t.c.\nIt is of the essence that government look into existing employment polices to ensure greater participation of youths. Government should focus on capital expenditure in order to increase the employment intensity of the private sector especially for MSMEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJenq, Christina, Jonathan Lain, and Tara Vishwanath. 2021. “Good Jobs for a New Generation: Delivering Quality Jobs for Young Nigerians After COVID-19.” https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/511161631652256763/pdf/Good-Jobs-for-a-New-Generation-Delivering-Quality-Jobs-for-Young-Nigerians-After-COVID-19.pdf.\n\n\nOzili, Peterson K. 2020. “COVID-19 Pandemic and Economic Crisis: The Nigerian Experience and Structural Causes.” Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences 37 (4): 401–18. https://doi.org/10.1108/jeas-05-2020-0074.\n\n\nPwC. 2018. “Structural Transformation and Jobless Growth in Nigeria.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/structural-transformation-jobless-growth-Nigeria.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2020. “Impact of COVID-19 on the Supply Chain Industry.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/impact-of-covid19-the-supply-chain-industry.pdf.\n\n\nWEF. 2020. “The Future of Jobs Report 2020.” https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf."

In the adulthood (time \\(t\\)) each individual is allowed to invest, borrow, and/or lend at the market interest rate \\(R~t~\\).\n\n\nThe amount of aggregate output produced in the adulthood (time \\(t\\)), \\(Y~t~\\), is determined by the aggregate stock of physical capital at time \\(t\\) (adulthood), \\(K~t~\\), and the existing amount of efficient labor \\(N~t~\\) — where \\(N~t~\\) is the amount of efficient labor—is defined as follows:2 (Rainer and Nardini, 2007)\n\\[\nN~t = \\lambda_tH_t^P + (1-\\lambda_t)L_t^P \\tag{1.1.1}\\\\    \n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\lambda_t \\in (0,1)\\), and \\(ρ≤1\\). \\(H_t\\) and \\(L_t\\) are numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively; where \\(H_t+L_t=Z_t\\). At different stages of economic development, unskilled (skilled) workers might be relatively more abundant than skilled (unskilled) workers for aggregated production.\nFollowing Rainer and Nardini (2007), we assume that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes if \\(ρ=1\\), and perfect complements if \\(ρ=-∞\\). Notice, however, that in Acemoglu (2002), the two inputs are referred to as gross substitutes if \\(0≤ρ&lt;1\\), and as gross complements if \\(ρ&lt;1\\). Let \\(φ_t\\) be the ratio of the number of skilled workers to that of all workers \\(Z_t\\). The aggregate supply of skilled workers at time t is \\(H_t=\\phi_t Z_t\\) and that of unskilled workers is \\(L_t=(1-φ_t)Z_t\\).\nThe aggregate production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form:\n\\[\nY~t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{1.1.2}\\\\     \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\),and \\(A&gt;0\\) stands for the level of technology. The market price of the final good is normalized to 1.\nProducers can freely rent the services of capital and labor from household through competitive factors markets. Hence, they maximize their profits given the market wages per unit of skilled and unskilled labors, \\(w_t^H,w_t^L\\) and the rental price per unit of physical capital, \\(R_t\\). Solving this problem is equivalent to choosing \\(H_t, L_t,and \\:K_t\\) that maximize \\(Y_t - w^HH_t - w_t^L L_t - r_t K_t\\) subject to \\(Y~t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha}\\) .The associated equilibrium wages of skilled and unskilled labors and the equilibrium price of physical capital are given by:\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) \\lambda \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1}    \n\\]\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) (1-\\lambda) \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} \\tag{1.1.3}\\\\     \n\\]\n\\[\nq_t = \\alpha \\frac{Y_t}{K_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\((s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))\\)is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6). In other terms the maximization can take the following form:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t + d_t^ir_{t+1} -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n        s_t^i = k_t + d_t^i \\\\\n        d_t^i \\ge-\\mu k_t\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nWe replace \\(d_t^i\\) by \\((s_t^i - K_t)\\) in the above maximization, and we combine the two last constraints to obtain the following maximization problem:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[r_{t+1}+q_{t+1}[\\phi^iq_{t+1} - r_{t+1}]k_t -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i \\tag{1.2.7}\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n0 \\le k_t \\le \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu}\n\\]\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\phi^i &lt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.3}\n\\]\nno member i would invest in real capital6.In this case, \\(k_t=0\\), and each member I hold his wealth in form of debt or bonds, i.e., \\(r_{t+1}d_t^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i = c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i\\).\nThe rest of the demand functions will follow from first order conditions with respect to \\(c_{t+1}^i\\) and \\(b_{t+1}^i\\) are given below:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^i = \\frac {\\beta}{1-\\beta}R_{t+1}q_t^i  \\tag{1.2.8}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(q_t^i\\) = \\(w_t^H + (b_t^H -P_t)\\) when \\(\\eta_t^i = 1\\), and \\(q_t^i = w_t^L + b_t^L\\), when \\(\\eta_t^i = 0\\); with \\(b_t^H - P_t &gt; 0\\).\nFollowing equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.5) we obtain the savings function below:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\frac {1+\\gamma - \\beta} {1+\\gamma} [(\\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1- \\eta_t^i )w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))]  \\tag{1.2.9}\n\\]\nIn this model, investment in education depends on the endowments for educated and uneducated cohorts. In order to properly deal with issues of poverty dynamics, we assume that skilled individuals remain skilled and unskilled individuals remain unskilled. \\(b_t^H\\) indicates bequest (or transfers from skilled parents) of skilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\) for each \\(t\\), and \\(b_t^L\\) indicates bequest for unskilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=0\\) for each \\(t\\). In addition to the assumption that individuals within a cohort are homogeneous and remain as such, we also assume that:\n\\[\nb_t^H \\ge P_t &gt; b_t^L \\ge 0. \\tag{A.A.4}\n\\]\nFollowing equations (1.1.3), (1.2.8), and (1.1.1.), and assuming that \\(s_t^i&gt;0\\), we obtain that demand for education can be inferred from the choice variable for transfers from parents to offspring. Consequently, the dynamical equation for \\(b_t^H\\) and \\(b_t^L\\) are, respectively, given by:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^H = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)\\lambda \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1} + b_t^H - pY_t], \\tag{1.2.10}\\\\   \n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^L = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\lambda) \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} + b_t^L ], \\tag{1.2.11}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac {Y_{t+1}} {k_{t+1}} \\equiv \\nu\\). 7 Equation (1.2.10) is the transfer from a skilled household of generation t, whereas, equation (1.2.11) is the transfer from an unskilled household of generation \\(t\\).\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\Phi^i &gt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.5}\n\\]\nThe solution to (1.2.7) is now easy to deal with as the individual will invest as much as he can in the real capital; hence he will hold both real capital and debt in his portfolio:\n\\[\nk_t = \\frac {s_t^i} {1-\\mu} \\tag{1.2.12}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_t^i = -  \\frac {\\mu} {1-\\mu} s_t^i \\tag{1.2.13}\n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i ] \\tag{1.2.14}\n\\]\nUsing (1.2.12) and (1.2.13) in (1.2.14), we find that\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu} [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^i - \\mu r_{t+1}] \\tag{1.2.15}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1-\\eta_t^i)w_t^L + (b_t^i-\\eta_t^iP_t)\\), and $ &gt; 0$. \\(\\mu\\) is the index of the financial market development (or deepening). The last result in (1.1.15) indicates that intergenerational transfers for education purposes might depend on the level of development of financial market.\nIn the next pages we will make a simplifying assumption that \\(\\phi^L \\le (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t &lt; \\phi^H\\).\nThe link between \\(b_{t+1}^H\\) \\((b_{t+1}^L)\\) and \\(b_t^H\\) \\((b_t^L)\\) is the most important relation for intergenerational dynamics of education and poverty. In particular,\n\\[\n\\Biggl(\\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial b_{t}^H}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^L}{\\partial b_t^L}\\Biggl) &gt;0 , \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial Y_{t}} &gt;0 \\Longleftrightarrow p &lt; \\frac {(1-\\alpha)\\lambda}{N_t}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial p} &lt; 0.\n\\]\nIn the absence of credit markets for investment in education, education costs have to be covered out of savings from parents,\\(b_t^i\\), which is an intergenerational transfer (or bequest). Therefore, the regression model for investment in education is isomorphic to equation (1.2.10). In this regards, a simple formal function is derived from (1.2.10) as follows:\n\\[\ne_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1e_t + \\beta_2y_2 + \\beta_3P_t+ \\xi_i + u_i \\tag{1.2.16}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_{t+1}\\) indicates the level of education of the next generation, \\(e_t\\) indicates the level of education of the current generation (parents), \\(\\tau y_t\\) is the costs of raising a child (it uses income per capita as proxy), \\(P_t\\) is the cost of investing in human capital for one member of cohort H of generation \\(t\\), \\(\\xi _i\\) reflects household unobserved characteristics, and \\(u_i\\) is an error term."

Consequently, the dynamical equation for \\(b_t^H\\) and \\(b_t^L\\) are, respectively, given by:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^H = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)\\lambda \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1} + b_t^H - pY_t], \\tag{1.2.10}\\\\   \n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^L = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\lambda) \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} + b_t^L ], \\tag{1.2.11}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac {Y_{t+1}} {k_{t+1}} \\equiv \\nu\\). 7 Equation (1.2.10) is the transfer from a skilled household of generation t, whereas, equation (1.2.11) is the transfer from an unskilled household of generation \\(t\\).\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\Phi^i &gt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.5}\n\\]\nThe solution to (1.2.7) is now easy to deal with as the individual will invest as much as he can in the real capital; hence he will hold both real capital and debt in his portfolio:\n\\[\nk_t = \\frac {s_t^i} {1-\\mu} \\tag{1.2.12}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_t^i = -  \\frac {\\mu} {1-\\mu} s_t^i \\tag{1.2.13}\n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i ] \\tag{1.2.14}\n\\]\nUsing (1.2.12) and (1.2.13) in (1.2.14), we find that\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu} [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^i - \\mu r_{t+1}] \\tag{1.2.15}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1-\\eta_t^i)w_t^L + (b_t^i-\\eta_t^iP_t)\\), and $ &gt; 0$. \\(\\mu\\) is the index of the financial market development (or deepening). The last result in (1.1.15) indicates that intergenerational transfers for education purposes might depend on the level of development of financial market.\nIn the next pages we will make a simplifying assumption that \\(\\phi^L \\le (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t &lt; \\phi^H\\).\nThe link between \\(b_{t+1}^H\\) \\((b_{t+1}^L)\\) and \\(b_t^H\\) \\((b_t^L)\\) is the most important relation for intergenerational dynamics of education and poverty. In particular,\n\\[\n\\Biggl(\\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial b_{t}^H}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^L}{\\partial b_t^L}\\Biggl) &gt;0 , \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial Y_{t}} &gt;0 \\Longleftrightarrow p &lt; \\frac {(1-\\alpha)\\lambda}{N_t}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial p} &lt; 0.\n\\]\nIn the absence of credit markets for investment in education, education costs have to be covered out of savings from parents,\\(b_t^i\\), which is an intergenerational transfer (or bequest). Therefore, the regression model for investment in education is isomorphic to equation (1.2.10). In this regards, a simple formal function is derived from (1.2.10) as follows:\n\\[\ne_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1e_t + \\beta_2y_2 + \\beta_3P_t+ \\xi_i + u_i \\tag{1.2.16}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_{t+1}\\) indicates the level of education of the next generation, \\(e_t\\) indicates the level of education of the current generation (parents), \\(\\tau y_t\\) is the costs of raising a child (it uses income per capita as proxy), \\(P_t\\) is the cost of investing in human capital for one member of cohort H of generation \\(t\\), \\(\\xi _i\\) reflects household unobserved characteristics, and \\(u_i\\) is an error term."

    "text": "We consider a closed overlapping-generations economy operating over an infinite discrete time horizon, starting with period 0. Individuals with perfect foresight invest in education and assets under capital market imperfection. However, the production of a single good occurs in a perfectly competitive environment where a single good produced can be consumed, invested, or passed on to the next generation. Population is exogenous and technology is assumed to be exogenous and stationary over time. Markets are imperfect in the sense that borrowing in the earlier periods of life for education acquisition is not possible. In particular, investment in education, which is apparently indivisible in this model, has to be financed out of savings of parents.1 In the adulthood (time \\(t\\)) each individual is allowed to invest, borrow, and/or lend at the market interest rate \\(R_t\\).\n\n\nThe amount of aggregate output produced in the adulthood (time \\(t\\)), \\(Y_t\\), is determined by the aggregate stock of physical capital at time \\(t\\) (adulthood), \\(K_t\\), and the existing amount of efficient labor \\(N_t\\) — where \\(N_t\\) is the amount of efficient labor—is defined as follows:2 (Rainer and Nardini, 2007)\n\\[\nN_t = \\lambda_tH_t^P + (1-\\lambda_t)L_t^P \\tag{1.1.1}\\\\    \n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\lambda_t \\in (0,1)\\), and \\(ρ≤1\\). \\(H_t\\) and \\(L_t\\) are numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively; where \\(H_t+L_t=Z_t\\). At different stages of economic development, unskilled (skilled) workers might be relatively more abundant than skilled (unskilled) workers for aggregated production.\nFollowing Rainer and Nardini (2007), we assume that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes if \\(ρ=1\\), and perfect complements if \\(ρ=-∞\\). Notice, however, that in Acemoglu (2002), the two inputs are referred to as gross substitutes if \\(0≤ρ&lt;1\\), and as gross complements if \\(ρ&lt;1\\). Let \\(φ_t\\) be the ratio of the number of skilled workers to that of all workers \\(Z_t\\). The aggregate supply of skilled workers at time t is \\(H_t=\\phi_t Z_t\\) and that of unskilled workers is \\(L_t=(1-φ_t)Z_t\\).\nThe aggregate production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form:\n\\[\nY_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{1.1.2}\\\\     \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\),and \\(A&gt;0\\) stands for the level of technology. The market price of the final good is normalized to 1.\nProducers can freely rent the services of capital and labor from household through competitive factors markets. Hence, they maximize their profits given the market wages per unit of skilled and unskilled labors, \\(w_t^H,w_t^L\\) and the rental price per unit of physical capital, \\(R_t\\). Solving this problem is equivalent to choosing \\(H_t\\), \\(L_t\\), and \\(\\:K_t\\) that maximize \\(Y_t - w^HH_t - w_t^L L_t - r_t K_t\\) subject to \\(Y_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha}\\) . The associated equilibrium wages of skilled and unskilled labors and the equilibrium price of physical capital are given by:\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) \\lambda \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1}    \n\\]\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) (1-\\lambda) \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} \\tag{1.1.3}\\\\     \n\\]\n\\[\nq_t = \\alpha \\frac{Y_t}{K_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6).

    "text": "A new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6). In other terms the maximization can take the following form:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t + d_t^ir_{t+1} -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n        s_t^i = k_t + d_t^i \\\\\n        d_t^i \\ge-\\mu k_t\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nWe replace \\(d_t^i\\) by \\((s_t^i - K_t)\\) in the above maximization, and we combine the two last constraints to obtain the following maximization problem:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[r_{t+1}+q_{t+1}[\\phi^iq_{t+1} - r_{t+1}]k_t -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i \\tag{1.2.7}\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n0 \\le k_t \\le \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu}\n\\]\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\phi^i &lt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.3}\n\\]\nno member i would invest in real capital6.In this case, \\(k_t=0\\), and each member I hold his wealth in form of debt or bonds, i.e., \\(r_{t+1}d_t^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i = c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i\\).\nThe rest of the demand functions will follow from first order conditions with respect to \\(c_{t+1}^i\\) and \\(b_{t+1}^i\\) are given below:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^i = \\frac {\\beta}{1-\\beta}R_{t+1}q_t^i  \\tag{1.2.8}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(q_t^i\\) = \\(w_t^H + (b_t^H -P_t)\\) when \\(\\eta_t^i = 1\\), and \\(q_t^i = w_t^L + b_t^L\\), when \\(\\eta_t^i = 0\\); with \\(b_t^H - P_t &gt; 0\\).\nFollowing equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.5) we obtain the savings function below:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\frac {1+\\gamma - \\beta} {1+\\gamma} [(\\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1- \\eta_t^i )w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))]  \\tag{1.2.9}\n\\]\nIn this model, investment in education depends on the endowments for educated and uneducated cohorts. In order to properly deal with issues of poverty dynamics, we assume that skilled individuals remain skilled and unskilled individuals remain unskilled. \\(b_t^H\\) indicates bequest (or transfers from skilled parents) of skilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\) for each \\(t\\), and \\(b_t^L\\) indicates bequest for unskilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=0\\) for each \\(t\\). In addition to the assumption that individuals within a cohort are homogeneous and remain as such, we also assume that:\n\\[\nb_t^H \\ge P_t &gt; b_t^L \\ge 0. \\tag{A.A.4}\n\\]\nFollowing equations (1.1.3), (1.2.8), and (1.1.1.), and assuming that \\(s_t^i&gt;0\\), we obtain that demand for education can be inferred from the choice variable for transfers from parents to offspring.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill. The model suggests that strategies aimed at growth of entrepreneurship and wages must distinguish between existing and potential entrepreneurs. For existing entrepreneurs reinvesting wages, a program of skill upgrade is more potent than supply of low price capital; the former leads to higher wages while the latter perpetuates low wages. For enterprises generating below- subsistence wages, a strict targeting program of low-cost capital is appropriate. For potential entrepreneurs, efforts should seek to combine skill development with frameworks to match new skills to commensurate capital. A public-private partnership could achieve this goal without burdening the private sector while simultaneously eliminating inefficiencies associated with public lending programs."

An enterprise is created by matching capital with worker’s skill. We assume that the size of a unit of capital corresponds to the level of technology. For example, a low-tech enterprise requires a small size of capital and a high-tech enterprise requires a large size of capital. The enterprise creation process that we imagine is such that a low-tech enterprise can be created by workers with low, medium or high skills if they are matched with a small size of capital but a low-skill worker cannot create a medium or high-tech enterprise. In terms of productivity and wages, a high skill worker may produce more than a low-skill worker in a low-tech enterprise, but his productivity will be lower in a low-tech enterprise than in a medium or high-tech enterprise.7 In addition to skill, an individual is endowed with initial asset a and can choose to either work for a wage or to run an enterprise. An individual in wage employment earns a market wage \\(w^m\\) that depends on his skill and a return on his asset of \\(r^m\\)a where \\(r^m\\) is the market interest rate. A worker who chooses to run an enterprise must devote his entire labor endowment to it. The difference between capital invested in the enterprise and the individual’s asset is borrowed from the capital market at the borrowing rate.\nWe focus on one-person enterprises where output is determined by the production function\n\\[\ny = f(s, k; \\theta)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich utilizes the worker’s observable skill s, physical capital k, where \\(k \\geq a\\) and unobservable worker’s ability captured by \\(\\theta\\). The production function is in all respects an individual version of the standard production function but in addition reflects the dimensions of human capital that are emphasize entrepreneurship literature. The human capital literature recognizes the potential correlation that exists between measurable skills and unmeasured ability (Bedard 2001). while the entrepreneurship literature emphasizes the importance of unmeasured ability in productivity (Evans and Jovanovic 1989).8\nThe entrepreneur’s labor is a fixed input while skill and capital are the variable inputs. In order to emphasize the matching of skill and capital while focusing on productivity of the match, we express the production technology as a function of skill-adjusted capital\n\\[\ny=f((s,k):\\theta)=f\\left(\\left(1,\\frac{k}{s}\\right):\\theta\\right)=f\\left(\\left(\\frac{k}{s}:\\theta \\right)\\right)=f(k:\\theta)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(k=\\frac{k}{s}\\) represents skill-adjusted input and \\(\\theta=\\theta(s)\\) is a shift parameter that depends on skill and has the property \\(\\theta'(s)&gt;0.\\) In essence, an enterprise is defined by a level of skill-adjusted capital. Equation 2 accounts for two properties of the model. First, an increase in n, conditional on unmeasured ability corresponds to an increase in the quantity of capital given the level of skill. Due to complimentarity between capital and skills as in standard production technologies, an increase in n will yield an increase output but a decrease in marginal output. Second, an increase in the level of skill, for example by replacing the worker with a more skilled worker, will lead to a decrease in n but shift the production function upward through the parameter \\(\\theta\\). The reason is that an increase in observable measure of human capital is associated with an upward shift in the unobserved measure of human capital. In order to reflect these properties, we make the following assumptions:\na) \\(f(k:\\theta)\\) is increasing and concave in \\(k:f_k&gt;0\\) and \\(f_{kk}&lt;0;\\)\nb) Output and marginal returns to adjusted capital both increase by unmeasured ability, that is,\n\\(f_\\theta &gt;0; f_{\\theta k}&gt;0;\\)\nc) The Inada conditions hold: \\(lim_{{k\\to0}} f_k =\\infty\\) and \\(lim_{{k\\to\\infty}} f_k=0.\\)\nThe variable inputs receive their marginal products while enterprise profits are paid to labor as wages.9 Capital is paid its rent and skill is paid its marginal product which is equivalent to the cost of skill acquisition. In general, the cost of skill is interpreted in terms of the cost of effort in learning the use of capital. Because the cost is small when skill is high relative to capital and is large when skill is low compared to capital, the cost of skill increases with the level of skill adjusted capital. We suppress \\(\\theta\\) in the meantime and define rent and wages respectively as\n\\[\nr(k)=f_k;w(k)=f(k)-kf_k-c(k)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwhere \\(c(k)\\) is the price of skill and \\(c'(k)&gt;0.\\) The output and earnings functions are shown in Figure 7 where each point on the horizontal axis represents an enterprise. Conditional on entrepreneur’s skill, output increases as increasing levels of capital are matched with the given skill until adjusted capital reaches \\(\\overline{k}\\) , the point after which additional capital yields no increase in output. Return to capital, or rent, is the slope of the production function. From the Inada conditions, the slope is infinitely large at low levels and decreases with the level of skill-adjusted capital. We define a threshold \\(\\underline{k}\\) as the minimum level of skill-adjusted capital for an enterpriseto be viable. For values of \\(k\\le{\\underline{k}},\\) the worker earns a negative wage due to a combination of low output and high rent. The price of skill is very low at this stage because the level of skill is high relative to capital. Nonetheless, there will be no activity in that interval because workers will have to pay rent by selling off other assets.10 The price of skill rises slowly, rent continues to fall and wages begin to rise gradually over the interval \\(\\underline{k}\\le{k}\\le{\\overline{k}}.\\) Irrespective of the amount of capital, a worker with a given level of skill can achieve output that is no more than \\(f(\\overline{k})\\) in the absence of skill upgrade. For values \\(k&gt;\\overline{k},\\) output remains nearly flat due to concavity of the production function and rent stays flat (near zero) as well but the cost of skill rises as skill levels relative to capital are falling. This leads to decrease in wages as we move beyond the point \\(\\overline{k}.\\) Therefore, the entrepreneur’s wage is maximized at \\(\\overline{k}.\\) We designate \\(\\overline{k}\\) as the efficient level of adjusted capital input, the level at which capital is commensurate with skill.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Output, Interest and Wages.\n\n\nWe demonstrate in in Figure 8 the effect of skill upgrade from \\(s\\) to \\(s'\\) reflected by a shift in the parameter \\(\\theta.\\) Given capital, skill upgrade shifts the output and rent curves upward but the extent of the shift increases with \\(k\\) in line with assumption b) above. The shift produces two effects. First, the point at which wages become positive shifts to the left reflecting the increase in productivity of skill. However, the shift at this end is small because output increases only by a little while rent also increases by a little; the net effect on \\(\\underline{k}\\) may be negligible. Second, the efficient level of adjusted capital shifts to the right in reflection of increased capacity of the worker to utilize a larger quantity of capital given the shift in unmeasured ability. In effect, the feasible range \\([\\underline{k},\\overline{k}]\\) widens with skill upgrade. However, because the skill cost function depends only on adjusted capital and not on output, it remains unchanged after the skill upgrade; the cost of skill only depends on the relative level of skill and capital along the horizontal axis. Thus the difference between the shift in output and the shift in rent widens as \\(k\\) increases, causing an increasing shift in the wage function. Consider an enterprise with initial adjusted capital of \\(k_0\\) that experienced a skill upgrade. Although adjusted capital decreases nominally from \\(k_0\\) to \\(k_1\\), wage increases from \\(w(k_0)\\) to \\(w(k_1)\\). It is also plausible from the rent graph that \\(r(k_1)&gt;r(k_0)\\) In general, an increase in wage is accompanied by increase in rent when driven by skill upgrade (represented by the upward shift in the rent curve) , but is accompanied by a decrease in rent when it is driven by capital upgrade (represented by moving to the right on the horizontal axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Effect of Skill Upgrade.\n\n\nWe examine in Figure 9 the potential wage trajectory of enterprises with efficient levels of adjusted capital to demonstrate the implication of the earnings and cost structure for enterprise profitability. The vertical axis represents capital while the horizontal axis represents skill. We use the 45 degrees line to represent wage outcomes of optimal matches between skill and capital where skill and capital are commensurate. Because skill and capital are typically measured in very different units and scales which we do not attempt to reconcile, the 45 degrees line reflects \\(commensurability\\) instead of \\(equality\\) of skill and capital. In essence, skill upgrade is matched by corresponding increase in capital as we move along the line so that wages earned by optimal matches increase along the line. Figure 8 is connected to Figure 9 in the sense that an enterprise with \\(k&gt;\\overline{k}\\) lies above the 45 degrees line while an enterprise with \\(k&lt;\\overline{k}\\) lies below the line.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Enterprise Wage Trajectory.\n\n\nThe broken vertical line at \\(s=s_0\\) represents the locus of initial adjusted capital of an enterprise. Consider an enterprise that starts with \\(k_a\\) where the capital is less than commensurate with skill (this translates to a very small value of \\(k\\) in Figure 8. At that level, output is low, the price of skill is low but rent is high, yielding a very low wage. An enterprise that begins at this point will find the cost of capital prohibitive and is unlikely to invest in capital. Because the cost of skill is low, the enterprise may choose to invest in more skills. But the enterprise will not benefit from such investment as it will not raise wages meaningfully: adjusted capital will decrease and rent will increase. The high rate of rent will eat away any increase in output achieved by raising the level of skill. In the absence of any investment, the high rent will drive enterprise wages westward until reaching the point a on the 45 degrees line.\nIt is interesting to note that equilibrium wage for the enterprise that started at \\(k_a\\) is exactly the wage that would be earned by an individual with skill \\(s_a\\) that is provided with capital that is just efficient for the worker, which results in adjusted capital of \\(\\overline{k}_a\\). Therefore an individual entrepreneur with skill \\(s_0\\) will earn the same wage as an individual with skill \\(s_a&lt;s_0\\). An enterprise that begins with \\(k_b\\) will face a similar experience. Consider an enterprise that begins at \\(k_c.\\) In that region, rent and cost of skill are both moderate but rent is falling while the cost of skill is rising. In the absence of any upgrade, or considering increase in skills only, enterprise wage will reach equilibrium at point \\(c\\) on the trajectory. However, additional investment in capital only, such as through reinvestment of wages, will lead enterprise wage northward until it reaches \\(w(\\overline{k}_0)\\). Intuitively, additional capital is being added to a production process that is utilizing relatively high entrepreneurial skill. As a result, wages rise until it reaches the efficient level. However, additional investment in both capital and skills, with more on the capital side (maybe through wage reinvestment) to take advantage of falling rent, will raise wages and lead the enterprise to point \\(d\\) on the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_d\\) faces similar situation as one that starts at \\(k_C\\) with the difference that it has to invest more in skill than capital. Because of rising cost of skills, wages will initially fall as the entrepreneur invests in more skill until the enterprise latches onto the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_e\\) has very low skill compared to capital and faces prohibitive cost of skill but very low cost of capital. In the absence of skill upgrade due to the high cost, wages will fall and the enterprise will shrink in terms of capital until it reaches the size of an enterprise that started at \\(k_d\\) when it can begin investing in skill because skill costs are now moderate. Thus, an enterprise that started out with much larger capital than skill will shrink at first before it can grow.\nEvery enterprise will reach an equilibrium that is represented by a point on the 45 degree line. Given that entrepreneurs reinvest wages net of consumption in practice, an enterprise moves vertically north of its old equilibrium because capital increases through wage reinvestment while skill remains unchanged. In the absence of a matching skill upgrade, wages will fall and the firm will be back to its old equilibrium 11.However, investment in additional skills will move the reinvesting enterprise eastward and therefore move to another point on the 45 degree line.\nEnterprise stability depends on two conditions. First, equilibrium wage must exceed a threshold level: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w_0\\) where \\(w_0\\ge0\\) is a floor wage12. for example \\(w(\\overline{k}_b)&lt;w_0\\) implies that enterprises at point \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Figure 9 are unstable. Second, equilibrium wage must be not less than the starting efficient wage: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w(\\overline{k})^0\\) where \\(w(\\overline{k})^0\\) is is the wage that should have been earned if the initial match was efficient given the worker’s skill. This condition implies that an enterprise at point \\(c\\) is also unstable. Combining the two conditions, the stability condition is\n\\[\nw(\\overline{k})^0 \\le w(\\overline{k})^0 \\ge w_0.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 4 implies that an enterprise is stable only if the capital-skill “gap” is within a small neighborhood where rent and the cost of skill upgrade are both small. This is intuitively the goal of credit assessment prior to lending. While lenders are unlikely to create the exact efficient match \\(k=\\overline{k}\\), they endeavor to create matches within a neighborhood \\(k \\in (\\overline{k} -\\delta, \\overline{k} +\\delta)\\) that satisfies condition (4)."

    "section": "3.1 Structure of Enterprise Sector",
    "text": "3.1 Structure of Enterprise Sector\nThe enterprise sector comprises entities where entrepreneurs employ their endowed assets without borrowing as well as entities created through borrowing. For enterprises financed solely by endowed assets, given the possibility of borrowing to ease credit constraints, it must be the case that \\(\\alpha = \\overline{k}.\\) It is therefore safe to assume that self-financed enterprises are positioned along the \\(w(\\overline{k})\\) trajectory depending on the equilibrium wage determined by the match between endowed assets and skills15. The assumption is not implausible for the following reason. The framework implies that such enterprises cannot grow by merely adding capital because adjusted capital is at the efficient level. That is, profit reinvestment only, without skill upgrade, will not lead to increase in wages. This implication is compatible with evidence from various studies of self employment suggesting that entrepreneurship skills are the most important constraint to small business growth (Yahya et al. 2011).\nEnterprises created through borrowing face entirely different dynamics. In general the worker and the lender must have incentives to create an enterprise. Given the opportunity cost of capital of \\(r^m\\) and alternative wages of \\(w^m\\), the joint surplus of the worker and the lender in creating the enterprise is given by\n\\[\nV(k) = [w(k)-w^m -r^ma][r(k)-r^m]\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe first term on the right side is the worker’s surplus which is the difference between enterprise wage and the opportunity cost: alternate wages and forgone income from endowed assets.\nSimilarly, the second term is the lender’s surplus which is the excess of rent over the opportunity cost of capital. An enterprise will be created if and only if the worker and the lender earn positive surpluses. Indeed, creation of an enterprise is subject to the existence constraint\n\\[\nV(k) \\ge V_0(w_0,r_0)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(w_0\\) is a floor wage and \\(r_0\\) is a floor return required by lenders. We now investigate how changes in the exogenous variables affect both the size and the structure of the enterprise sector.\nConsider an increase in interest rates \\(r^m\\). Lenders’ surplus decrease as the opportunity cost of capital increases. As a result, lenders must ration capital by pursuing either of two options. One, they can reduce the amount of capital offered to all intending entrepreneurs. But this option will lead to a general decrease in wages so that more enterprises would violate the stability constraint (4). Second, they can exclude lending to low-tech enterprises that would not satisfy the existence constraint following the increase in interest rate. The resultant upward shift in skills leads to increases in both wages and rent. This shift is illustrated in Figure 11 . Supply of capital falls on the lender’s side of the market and causes the enterprise labor demand curve to shift to the left. At the same time, an increase in interest rate reduces the worker’s surplus through increase in return on endowed asset. In response, workers with low skills who are unable to generate the required return will exit the enterprise sector causing the supply curve to shift to the left, causing a decrease in the quantity of labor and increase in average skills. Skill-adjusted capital reduces nominally but the production function shifts upward as presented in Figure 8. Because the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, adjusted capital decreases and wage increases in comparison to the initial equilibrium. In effect, rising interest rates squeeze out low-skill-low-tech enterprises because they are unable to generate positive surpluses at prevailing costs. On the other hand, a decrease in interest rates pushes the demand and supply curves to the right, resulting in higher skill-adjusted capital, large number of low-skill-low-tech enterprises, and lower wages in equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Increase in Interest rate r\n\n\nAn increase in alternate wage \\(w^m\\) reduces only the worker’s side of the surplus function, and workers with low entrepreneurial skills will exit from the enterprise sector, leading the enterprise labor supply curve to shift to the left while the demand curve remains unchanged. As shown in Figure 12, skill-adjusted capital falls and equilibrium wage rises. On the other hand, a decrease in \\(w^m\\) raises the workers’ surplus and attracts more workers into entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Increase in Alternate Wages w\n\n\nAverage skills decrease, and skill-adjusted capital increases, leading to lower equilibrium wages. Thus, an increase in interest rates or alternate wages has the effects of raising average skills and wages in the enterprise sector. This is consistent with the stylized facts: co-movement of interest rates and wages, and co-movement of wages across sectors. But the extent of wage increase and changes in adjusted capital depend on whether the change is driven by wages or interest rates. Changes in relative enterprise wages (ratio of enterprise wages to alternate wages) depends on the ease of entry into the enterprise sector, which depends on the ease of finding capital. If credit markets are well developed so that entry and exit from self employment is unconstrained, then relative enterprise wages will fall and rise faster than in societies with less developed credit markets."

    "text": "4.1 Skill and Capital Mobility\nIn general, there are skill overlaps between the sectors. Workers at the high end of the agricultural sector skill distribution are comparable to workers in the enterprise sector.16 Similarly, some workers at the high end of the enterprise sector skill distribution are those who could be in the formal wage sector but voluntarily choose the entrepreneurship sector. Given the impracticality of direct transition from the agricultural sector to the formal wage sector for many workers, inter-sectoral mobility assumes the form of a step-like or “ladder” function.17 We assume a fixed-capital economy with mobility of capital and labor across sectors. Increase in agricultural or urban formal wage draws workers away from the enterprise sector while a decrease has the reverse effect. Whenever workers are drawn away from enterprise sector, the workers left behind are selectively more productive. It is plausible to assume that individuals with higher entrepreneurial skills are less likely to leave the enterprise sector."

    "section": "4.2 General Equilibrium Dynamics",
    "text": "4.2 General Equilibrium Dynamics\nConsider the impact of growth in the formal wage sector. Given the supply of skills, the labor demand curve shifts to the right and wages and employment both increase. This leads to increase in alternate wages, which will reduce employment in the enterprise sector. Individuals with high skill but end up at points a, b and c in Figure 9 will be the first set to exit the sector due to underemployment of their skills. Although some low-tech enterprises might remain because some low-skill workers could remain, enterprise wages will nevertheless increase. The increase in enterprise wages might attract agricultural workers with above-average skills, especially in cases where agriculture is predominantly peasant and small-scale, leading to a decrease in average skills and reduction in agricultural wages.\nAn increase in agricultural wage, driven by technological change or improvement in climatic conditions, raises alternate wages for workers at the bottom of skill distribution in the enterprise sector. Low-skill workers in low-tech enterprises will exit the enterprise sector for the agricultural sector, leading to higher wages, higher skills and lower employment in the enterprise sector. The impact on the formal sector would at best be minimal. While some workers may move directly from the formal wage sector into agriculture, the increase in enterprise wages may also attract comparable workers from the formal sector. The net effect on the formal wage sector depends on the part of the skill distribution that workers exit from.\nA strategy of reducing the cost of enterprise capital increases the surplus on the workers’ side of the joint surplus function. Workers move out of the agricultural and formal wage employments into entrepreneurship, shifting the entrepreneurship labor supply curve to the right. However, the effect on the lenders’ side depends on whether the program is a private or a public sector initiative. If private lenders reduce their interest rates but continue to appraise loans on the basis of productivity, they are likely to remain selective in terms of enterprise skills in order to reduce the risks of default. The reduction of lending rate is reflected in a movement along the demand curve. Conditional on supply adjustment, enterprise wages will decrease and skill adjusted capital will increase as in Figure 13. On the other hand, if the lending policy is driven by public policy, the outcome will be as if interest rates are reduced exogenously, which also leads to lower wages and higher skill-adjusted capital. However, for identical reduction in interest rate, the difference lies in the degree to which the skill composition of the sector changes, which can be deduced by comparing Figure 13 (drawn to yield identical reduction in interest rate) and a reversal of Figure 11. Notice that, in equilibrium, the increase in adjusted capital (decrease in overall level of skill) is very large in the case of public policy and very small in the case where private lenders cut lending rates. That is, the selective mechanism of private lenders that accompany reduction of lending rates allows minor reductions in enterprise productivity while the skill blind process that accompanies public low-interest capital schemes largely undermine productivity.\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Low interest lending from private sector.\n\n\nSuppose instead that vocational or entrepreneurial skill is upgraded. That is, instead of quantitative increase in labor supply we have a qualitative increase in entrepreneurial skills, which shifts the supply curve to the left. In this case, adjusted capital will fall (capital-skill gap will close) and wages will rise. Thus, skill upgrade is more potent than low-cost capital for poverty reduction. Stagnation in production processes with more credit supply has generated increased employment in the enterprise sector but has not made a significant dent on poverty rates. Low-productivity activities are easy to replicate and they generate low returns when matched with low cost capital. Studies relating to Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises show that lack of skills, rather than lack of capital, are responsible for the slow growth of the sector.\nHowever, the policy of skill upgrade alone must be directed toward those already engaged in entrepreneurship and are reinvesting wages. Suppose that unemployed workers, those outside entrepreneurship, are provided with additional skills. In the absence of deliberate efforts to expand access to enterprise capital (not by cutting lending rates), these workers will become job seekers in the formal sector rather than becoming entrepreneurs. Considering the wage profile where the formal sector offers the highest returns, these newly trained workers would simply join the pool of unemployed workers seeking formal employment."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAlthough many factors have been advanced for expansion of self‐employment, the government initiatives were undoubtedly central. In order to combat high unemployment that persisted into the late 1970s, the British government under Margaret Thatcher created several initiatives aimed at supporting self‐employment beginning from 1981. These initiatives include the Enterprise Allowance Scheme which provided guaranteed income of GBP40 per week to unemployed people that set up an enterprise, the Loan Guarantee Scheme through which the government provided the security that lenders usually require in order to facilitate lending to viable small businesses that may lack access to finance, and the Business Expansion Scheme that aimed to provide investment opportunities for investors↩︎\nThese efforts came in many forms. There were pressures on lending institutions to reduce interest rates, leading to development of enterprise finance initiatives by commercial banks and other financial institutions. Some assistance also came in the form of credit guarantees. These efforts drew a large number among the unemployed workers into entrepreneurship.↩︎\nGovernments in Africa and other developing countries implemented low‐cost capital schemes during 1970s and early 1980 and the outcomes were self‐defeating. Earnings plunged, default rates rose and poverty rates arising from very low wages skyrocketed. The self‐defeating growth of higher employment and lower wages following increased supply of low‐cost capital could be attributed to several factors. First, an exogenous decrease in the cost of capital will result in lower average skills and therefore reduce enterprise productivity. Output produced by low‐ tech enterprises is typically non‐tradable and only subject to demand for domestic consumption. In countries where imported goods are favored over domestic products due to either preferences or quality issues, low‐tech enterprise output growth is associated with product glut and low prices. Second, other than capital requirement, there is free‐entry into the sector and low‐tech production systems can easily be replicated. Free entry ensures that output prices and therefore earnings are driven to razor‐thin competitive levels. The absence of institutional barriers and coordination failures make price regulations impossible. Third, an increased supply of capital that is not driven by skills will have different implications than supply shift that is driven by skills. Increased supply of capital that is driven by skill upgrade moves the enterprise sector toward more productive enterprises and leads to higher wages. On the other hand, an increase in the supply of capital without efficient matching leads to lower wages and reduction in enterprise efficiency levels.↩︎\nExpectation of positive selection on ability into wage employment in non‐competitive labor markets is based on the assumption that individuals with high ability are likely to be selected by employers. In non‐clearing markets, employers subject job candidates to series of tests – written, oral and situation‐room types of experiences – in order to select the most able candidates. Because these opportunities are limited, individuals with the highest abilities are often drawn into wage employment at least for the first few years of their careers. However, the sample of workers who seek wage employment may not be representative of the labor force. Indeed, if individuals with the highest levels of ability choose not to seek wage employment, then positive selection on ability into wage employment among job‐seekers will not translate into positive selection on ability for the entire labor force.↩︎\nA loan guarantee reduces the cost of capital in two ways. First, it eliminates the transactions cost component of lending rates. Second, it eliminates the opportunity cost associated with forgone earnings from assets that would otherwise be pledged as collateral.↩︎\nThe deficit of attention to skill and capital matching is not surprising. It is always assumed, and taken for granted, that the credit market is capable of creating efficient matches between capital and skill in the formation of enterprises. But there are noteworthy grounds to believe that this is not always the case. The practice in the credit market to screen borrowers on the basis of perception of information asymmetry rather than on the basis of borrowers’ productivity implies that high productivity individuals lacking collateral may be denied access to entrepreneurship capital.↩︎\nCompare a high school dropout with a Masters’ of Science in civil engineering. Both of them can fry plantains but the dropout cannot supervise road construction. Meanwhile, it is possible that the M.Sc. will fry more plantains in a unit of time than the dropout. In an economy endowed by capital for frying plantains, everyone would fry plantain. On the other hand, if capital is only available for road construction, then the engineers are employed while the dropouts are unemployed. If capital is only available for road construction in an economy populated by high school dropouts, then no construction enterprise is created and nobody is employed.↩︎\nAn individual’s education or skill is positively correlated with his unmeasured ability. It is implausible that the level of education an individual attains alone summarizes all the productive skills that may be productive in entrepreneurship, neither is it plausible to assume that innate ability alone summarizes them. Existence of complementarities between observed education and unobserved ability is arguably plausible.↩︎\nThis is consistent with the practice where the profits of the enterprise are considered as earnings of the entrepreneur. The only difference is that we separate returns to labor from returns to skill in the model.↩︎\nThis corresponds to an extremely high rate of underutilization (or underemployment) of worker skills.↩︎\nThe conditions under which an enterprise remains in equilibrium are discussed in details in Appendix A.↩︎\nThe wage floor increases with the cost of capital and alternate wages.↩︎\nIntuitively, rising wages indicate higher returns in the sector, and attracts more workers and lenders as long as rent exceeds the cost of capital. This leads to increase in capital supplied to the sector, and consequently, decrease in rent.↩︎\nDetails of the derivation are provided in Appendix B.↩︎\nThe literature on intergenerational wealth transfer has examined the possibility that individuals who receive large bequeaths are also likely to come from households endowed with high entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, we expect to observe a strong correlation between enterprise skill and endowed asset in a cross‐section of entrepreneurs.↩︎\nBoth sets of workers are likely to have had some formal education and vocational or apprenticeship training.↩︎\nFor example, unskilled workers from the rural area that arrive in the urban center in search of formal sector jobs must enroll in appropriate skill development program or course of study that may take some time to complete. In the meantime, such workers will engage in activities in the entrepreneurship sector or otherwise remain unemployed while attending school. It is on this basis that the model reconciles with the previous models that describe the enterprise sector as a transit sector.↩︎\nA reading of Yunus (2003) shows that early microcredit was targeted at workers with observable productivity. One of the weaknesses inherent in subsequent microfinance practice is that loans are often targeted at workers with latent productivity. The non‐observability of productivity for many of the clients and the lack of sensitivity of loan amounts to productivity introduced important imperfections in the capital‐skill matching process in microcredit schemes.↩︎"

    "text": "This paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill.

    "text": "This paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill. The model suggests that strategies aimed at growth of entrepreneurship and wages must distinguish between existing and potential entrepreneurs. For existing entrepreneurs reinvesting wages, a program of skill upgrade is more potent than supply of low price capital; the former leads to higher wages while the latter perpetuates low wages.

    "section": "",
    "text": "President Jonathan seems to realize that good governance and service delivery matters most at the local council levels. He also seems to understand the constraints to performance at that level and is willing to tackle them. A noble attempt made in pursuit of this goal was a proposed constitutional amendment in August 2011 to scrap the special state-local council joint account with a view to granting the local councils financial autonomy. Under the present arrangement, allocations to local councils are deposited into the special account. Unfortunately, those accounts are controlled by the state governors and local councils are funded at their discretions. The perennial abuse of the system must have prompted the president to propose the amendment. However, the proposal met with a staunch opposition from the state governors, and the president did little to push the issue further.\nIn the matters of governance and development, the local council is the place where the rubber meets the road. The set of activities that fall within the purview of local councils are the building blocks of all indices of good governance, economic growth and human development. According to the 1999 constitution, which is currently in force, local councils are responsible for primary, adult and vocational education, health services, agriculture and natural resource development. More importantly, the local council is the level of government that is most accessible and can be most accountable to the citizens. Poor villagers who cannot afford the cost of transportation to state capitals or the national capital can walk to their local councils to make their voices heard and demand accountability for service provisions.\nLocal councils are treated as cash cows by state governors and political party “kingmakers” rather than development centers that they are designed to be. Local council chairmen are typically nominated by their parties, whose de-facto leaders are the state governors, and supported financially by kingmakers who expect to be paid back. This gives room for resource leakages and other forms of abuse of public treasury in the sense that funds meant for basic services are diverted for personal uses.\nThe consequences of abuse of the joint-account framework over the years are devastating. Nigeria is ranked among the 16 countries with the highest infant mortality rate in the world1 and its adult literacy rate stands at only 61 percent. Public primary education has been starved of funds and is being attended by only the poor who cannot afford private school. With around 70 percent poverty rate, the majority of children are given poor quality of education. A poor quality of basic primary education is a poor foundation for higher learning. Little wonder then that the country is faced with graduates of higher institutions who are lacking in productive skills. It is not surprising that we are faced with youth unemployment of alarming proportion. In order to turn this situation around, the President and the national assembly must find ways to grant financial autonomy to local councils to ensure that they have the funds to provide the infrastructure required in their schools and hospitals, and pay their teachers and hospital staff in time.\nIt is a welcome development that the national assembly is considering a revision of the 1999 constitution. Good enough, local council reforms have been included in the agenda. However, the existing constitution has provided the structures for good governance, but they are in very weak positions. The focus of this constitutional review, as far as local government is concerned, should be granting financial autonomy to local councils and strengthening the system to ensure proper oversight over the council chairmen. Responsible authorities, including the electoral bodies, need to convince and assure citizens that their rights to recall elected officials are guaranteed and the process is seen to be transparent by all at all times.\nIt is not clear that average Nigerians care so much about how many years a president or a governor spends in office and whether they run for one term or three. It is not even clear that they care about how long a local council chairman is in office. What they care about is a local government system that is accountable and effective in delivering services. The pervasive focus of governance reforms on federal and state governments obviously has very little or nothing to do with the quality of governance at the local level where it really matters."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Harris and Todaro (1970) model of urban unemployment remains one of the historically insightful tools for analyzing urban unemployment problems in less developed countries (LDCs): a politically determined urban minimum wage set above rural agricultural wage draws rural workers into urban unemployment. Unfortunately, the urban informal sector that has become the largest employer of labor in the recent history of developing countries and its dynamics were largely underdeveloped at the time that the model was written. It is therefore not surprising that recent tests of the relationship between minimum wage and urban unemployment in different developing country settings demonstrate a failing of the model’s prediction. In this paper, I make two main extensions to the model: I include an urban informal flexible-wage sector and allow for both rural-urban and urban-rural migration; and link rural wage to the size of rural labor. The urban sector is divided into the formal and the informal segments by the minimum wage and urban unemployment is driven by both rural-urban migrants and urban non-migrants. These extensions to the model yield three new insights: (1) an increase in minimum wage is not a precondition for rural-urban migration, (2) urban unemployment is driven largely by wage comparisons between the urban formal and informal sectors, and (3) urban unemployment is largely voluntary. The implication of the model is straightforward: the best strategy to reduce urban unemployment is to develop the urban informal sector. I discuss some policy choices."

    "section": "3.2 Expected Wages",
    "text": "3.2 Expected Wages\nRural agricultural wage denoted \\(W_R\\) represents the average or “shared” product in agriculture. Urban formal and informal wages given by \\(W_F\\) and \\(W_l\\) respectively are valued in terms of marginal product. If the marginal product of an urban formal worker falls below the minimum wage, the firm subcontracts the work to the informal sector. The main assumption is that, \\(W_F \\ge\\) \\(\\overline{W}_M \\ge\\) \\(W_l\\) where \\(\\overline{W}_M\\) is the minimum wage.\nI distinguish between the urban wage that enters the decision process of a rural worker who is considering urban migration and the urban wage that is taken into consideration by an individual who is unemployed in the city. A rural worker considering migration estimates an expected urban wage using the distribution of urban employment. Urban expected wage is given by the expression\n\\[W^e_U = \\frac{N_F}{N_U}W_F + \\frac{N_I}{N_U}W_I \\tag{4}\\]\nThe presence of the informal sector in (4) diminishes the effect of the minimum wage on migration. For simplicity assume that there is no excess demand for labor in the formal sector so that \\(W_F = \\overline{W}_M\\)Then equation (4) implies that \\(W^E_U = \\frac{N_F}{N_U}\\overline{W}_M + \\frac{N_I}{N_U}W_I\\) As the share of formal sector in urban labor market \\(\\left(\\frac{N_F}{N_U}\\right)\\) diminishes, urban expected wage approximates informal sector wage and the role of the minimum wage fizzles in migration decision. This is particularly important in developing countries where an estimated 80 to 85 percent of urban employment is generated in the informal sector. Macharia (2003, 1) captures this idea by noting that\n.. with the proliferation of the informal economy in the 1980s and 1990s, migrants who were entrepreneurial still had hopes in the urban areas. This was so, mainly because of the expectations of higher numbers of people who would become consumers of products they hoped to make and sell in the urban areas. Thus, it is not simply the “hope for employment in the urban areas that pulls people to the urban areas but also the hope of venturing in an economic activity in the informal sector!\nIndeed, from equation (4), sufficiently (high) low earnings in the informal sector or high rates of urban unemployment are (incentives) disincentives for rural-urban migration as they drive urban expected wage (upward) downward. This is the case even when the urban minimum wage is unchanged. However, rural-urban migration could continue unabated as rural population pressure depresses the rural wage further below the urban informal wage.\nThere is another kind of expected wage that enters the decision of the urban unemployed worker who is contemplating whether to remain in the city of return to the rural sector. Once a worker is in the city, the distribution of urban employment does not matter for evaluation of urban wages. To the worker, expected (weighted average) urban wage is given by18\n\\[W^\\alpha_U = \\alpha W_F + (1 - \\alpha)W_I \\tag{5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the formal sector share of urban employment or the probability that the urban employed worker is in the formal sector. Notice that the coefficients in equation (4) are the shares of urban total labor while the coefficients in equation (5) are the shares of urban employment. In the presence of urban unemployment, the latter shares are larger than the former, yielding \\(W^\\alpha_U &gt; W^e_U\\) ."

    "section": "3.3 Equilibrium",
    "text": "3.3 Equilibrium\nEmpirical literature shows that reverse migration had become part of normal life since the 1970s not merely for the elderly who return home to retire but also for young and middle age individuals (Reed, Andrzejewski, and White 2010). Therefore an equivalent of equation (9) of Harris and Todaro (1970) is inadequate to describe the equilibrium when faced with return migration19. Instead of writing two equations, one for rural-to-urban and another for urban-to-rural migrations, I first derive the component of excess labor that would migrate from urban to rural sector and then obtain an equilibrium by equating the rural-to-urban migration and urban-to-rural migration components. The remaining part of this section builds on the framework proposed by (Fields 1975).\nThe urban formal sector is the prime sector of interest for most workers.20 Inasmuch as nearly everyone likes to work there, access to jobs in the sector is limited. Individuals who are unable to obtain a job can choose one of three strategies: continue to queue or search for a job opening while remaining unemployed; find work in the informal sector; or return to the rural sector. The labor market exhibits a hierarchy of sectors where difficulty of access to a job decreases in order from the formal sector, the informal sector and the rural sector. I reflect the ease of access to jobs in the formal sector by the parameter \\(\\theta\\), subject to \\(0 \\le\\theta \\le 1\\), which decreases as employment in the formal sector becomes harder to obtain. The hierarchical nature of employment choice implies that as \\(\\theta\\) decreases, larger factions of the labor force move into the states below the formal sector. An urban worker computes an expected formal wage by multiplying the formal wage by the chance of entry as \\(\\theta W_F\\).\nGiven this structure, the representative urban worker can be in one of four states. I measure the probability of being in each state by a simple function \\(V(X)\\) that depends linearly on its argument subject to the conditions \\(X\\ge0, V(0) = 0, V'(X)&gt;0\\) and \\(0\\le V(X) \\le1\\) The sorting of the urban worker into states and the corresponding probabilities are as follows:\nU1: Employed in the formal sector.\nU2: Remain unemployed and queue or search for formal employment. To make this choice, it must be that \\(\\theta W_F \\ge W_I\\) The probability of being in this state is thus measured by \\(V(\\theta W_F -W_I)\\).\nU3: Accept employment in the urban informal sector. For this choice, it must be the case that \\(\\theta W_F \\le W_I \\ge W_R\\). The probability of being in this state is measured by \\(V(W_I - W_R)\\).\nU4: Remain unemployed or join the return migrant pool. To be here, the condition \\(W_R \\ge W^\\alpha_U\\) must be satisfied. The probability of being in this state is measured by \\(V(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)\\).\nThe description of employment states yields a hierarchy of urban subsectors in which \\(\\theta\\) plays the role of a sorting parameter. As formal employment becomes competitive, individuals who do not obtain formal employment move into state U2 to queue or continue to search for formal jobs while remaining unemployed. A positive formal-informal expected wage gap \\((\\theta W_F -W_I)\\) provides the incentive to remain in this state as the average unemployed worker’s (expected) reservation wage exceeds the informal wage. As \\(\\theta\\) diminishes further and the expected wage premium disappears, the average unemployed worker becomes discouraged at formal job search and exits from unemployment to informal employment in state U3. That is, as formal employment becomes harder to find, in the absence of unemployment benefits, the worker finds it rational to accept an informal employment that he would otherwise reject. A further decrease in \\(\\theta\\) arising from further tightening of the formal employment sector pushes more workers from U1 into U2 and from U2 into U3 (the informal sector) and leads to further decrease in the informal wage until it falls below the rural wage \\((W_I &lt; W_R)\\), an occurrence which creates a disincentive to remain in urban informal employment. However, because formal employment is now tightened than ever, the average worker moves to state U4, the pool of unemployed urban proletariat who are discouraged and no longer looking for job and other workers that are willing to move to the rural sector once the condition is met. Potential return migrant workers in this group have a reservation wage that is equivalent to the rural wage, and remains in that state as long as \\(W^\\alpha_U \\ge W_R\\). Such worker returns to the rural sector when \\(W^\\alpha_U &lt; W_R\\).21\nThe notion that a worker who does not find a formal job has the option of informal employment in U3 but chooses to remain unemployed in U2 implies that urban unemployment is at least partly voluntary.22 The distribution of urban unemployment between voluntary and involuntary components will depend on factors that determine the extent of informal employment opportunities.23\nAccording to the definition, excess urban labor is the sum of labor in groups U2 and U4. Multiplying the measure of workers in the groups by total urban labor, excess urban labor is thus given by\n\\[\nN_{UE}= N_U[V(\\theta W_F - W_I) + V(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)]\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhere \\(N_UV(\\theta W_F - W_I)\\) is the size of labor in U2 and \\(N_UV(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)\\) is the size of labor in U4.\nI now turn to the rural sector where a worker can either work in rural agriculture or migrate to the urban sector. I assume, in line with Harris and Todaro (1970) that all rural workers engage in agriculture and are part of the output-sharing group.24 I assume that rather than staying unemployed in the village, workers whose reservation wages exceed the rural wage would migrate to the city.25 The distribution of workers into employment and migration is given by\nR1: Work in rural agriculture if \\(W^e_U \\le W_R\\)\nR2: Migrate to the urban sector if \\(W^e_U \\ge W_R\\) The probability of migrating is measured by \\(V(W^e_U - W_R)\\).\nRural excess labor, all of which migrate to urban sector, is given by\n\\[\nN_{RE} = N_RV(W^e_U - W_R)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nEquations (6) and (7) provide the basis for analyzing the migration equilibrium. Equilibrium is attained when the flow of rural-urban migrants is balanced by the flow of urban-rural migrants. By making the migrating component of equation (6) equal to equation (7), the equilibrium is obtained from\n\\[\nN_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U) = N_RV(W^e_U - W_R)\n\\tag{8}\\]\nRearranging the terms of equation (8) and substituting \\(N_R = \\overline{N}-N_U\\), I obtain the migration equilibrium condition\n\\[\nV(W^e_U-W_R)/V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U) = N_U/(\\overline{N}-N_U)\n\\tag{9}\\]\nEquation (9) yields insights that are similar to Harris and Todaro (1970). A rural development program that leads to an increase in rural wage \\(W_R\\), conditional on all else, will reduce the left side by both reducing the numerator and increasing the denominator. To maintain equilibrium, the right side must also decrease by reducing the size of the urban labor. On the other hand, suppose wage increases or more jobs are created in the urban sector. This leads to increase in the left side by increasing the numerator and reducing the denominator. In response, more workers move to the city as the right side increases.26"

    "text": "3.4 Urban Unemployment in Equilibrium\nI now compare urban unemployment outcome under different strategies by examining their effects on both voluntary and involuntary components of urban unemployment.\nConsider the case of a marginal increase in agricultural wage from \\(W_R\\) to \\(W_R\\)’ following which urban labor force decreases from \\(N_U\\) to \\(N_U\\)’ The resulting urban unemployed labor is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}'= \\underbrace{N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{unchanged}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}'V({W_R}'-W^\\alpha_U)- N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nBecause unemployed workers in US2 are driven by the difference between expected formal wage and the informal wage, the measure of workers in the state is not affected by increase in rural wage.27 Because \\({N_U}'&lt;N_U\\) and \\(V({W_R}'-W^\\alpha_U)&gt;V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)\\), the second component of (10) will generate an offset, thus clearing unemployment in US4. However, these gains are limited and temporary. As these workers return to the farm, rural agricultural wage would fall relative to expected urban wage and induce a new round of urban migration, which will ultimately raise the level of urban unemployment again. The experience in Kenya in the 1970s, where return migrants sooner than later began to move back to cities provides evidence in this regard.28\nNext, consider an increase in urban formal wage from \\(W_F\\) to \\({W_F}^*\\) that increases the size of urban labor from \\(N_U\\) to \\({N_U}^*\\) . As more workers move from other states into US1 as a result of the wage increase, two other things happen. First, increase in formal wage widens the expected wage premium gap and draws more workers from the informal sector US3 and the unemployed pool US4 into job search in US2. Second, the increase in urban formal wage raises expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) and induces urban migration. In this case, the resulting urban unemployed labor following from equation (6) is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}^* = \\underbrace{{N_U}^*V(\\theta {W_F}^*-W_I)-N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{increase}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}^*V(W_R-{W_U^{\\alpha}}^*)-N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nwhere the first part measures the change in US2 and the second term measures the change in US4. Because \\({N_U}^*&gt; N_U, {W_F}^*&gt;W_F\\), and \\(V({W^{\\alpha}_U}^*-W_R)&gt;V(W^\\alpha_U-W_R)\\), the first part increases as formal wage increases while the terms of the second part are offsetting. The size of US4, the state that is home to the involuntarily unemployed, increases through migration from rural areas and decreases through movement of workers into states US1 to US3. In effect, increase in urban formal wage increases voluntary urban unemployment while offsetting involuntary unemployment. Overall, urban unemployment increases.\nAs a third option, consider an increase in urban informal wage from \\(W_I\\) to \\({W_I}^{\\wedge{}}\\) that leads to an increase in urban labor force from \\(N_U\\) to \\({N_U}^{\\wedge{}}\\). The increase in urban labor force is driven by increase in expected urban wage \\(W^a_U\\) arising from increase in informal wage. There are two distinct effects of this event. First, increase in \\(W_I\\) leads to reduction of the urban formal-informal wage premium and provides incentive for workers in US2 to accept informal employment, thereby reducing voluntary unemployment. Second, increase in \\(W_I\\) also induces unemployed workers in US4 who had been discouraged by low informal wage to enter the urban informal sector. Rural workers migrate from rural agriculture directly into the informal sector and thus do not contribute to unemployment. The resulting urban unemployed labor is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}^{\\wedge{}} = \\underbrace{{N_U}^{\\wedge{}}V(\\theta W_F-{W_I}^{\\wedge{}})-N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{offset}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}^{\\wedge{}}V(W_R-{W^\\alpha_U}^{\\wedge{}})-N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nBecause \\({N_U}^{\\wedge{}} &gt;N_U, V(\\theta W_F-{W_I}^{\\wedge{}}) &lt; V(\\theta W_F-W_I)\\) and \\(V(W_R-{W^\\alpha_U}^{\\wedge{}})&lt;V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)\\), both elements of (12) are offsets. In effect, increase in urban informal wage clears both voluntary and involuntary urban unemployment. This is achievable because while drawing workers who have been unemployed in urban areas due to the formal-informal wage premium into the informal sector (reducing unemployment at the top), it also provides opportunities for the unemployed potential return migrants. Earnings in rural agriculture will rise as workers migrate to urban informal sector until equilibrating wages are obtained. Under this strategy, average earnings are highest and overall unemployment is lowest, yielding the highest level of welfare achievable."

    "text": "3.5 Minimum Wage and Unemployment\nFrom the foregoing analysis, the most important determinant of urban unemployment is the formal sector-informal sector wage premium. To evaluate the importance of the minimum wage, let \\(W_F = \\overline{W}_M + X\\) and \\(W_I = \\overline{W}_M-Y\\), where \\(X\\) represents some form of efficiency wage premium and \\(Y\\) is the difference between informal wage and the minimum wage. Therefore, the formal-informal wage premium can be decomposed into\n\\[\n\\theta W_F- W_I = (\\theta X+Y)-(1-\\theta)\\overline{W}_M\n\\tag{13}\\]\nConsider an increase of \\(\\Delta\\overline{W}_M\\) in the minimum wage.

Unemployment depends only on the wage difference between the formal and informal sector, and the minimum wage is irrelevant. An increase in minimum wage only redistributes urban employment by increasing the relative size of the informal sector. This is consistent with the literature cited in the introduction section of this paper that changing the minimum wage has no effect on unemployment."

Because most of the off-farm nodes in the chain are located in urban areas, they represent potential sources of urban informal employment. The dairy sector in Uganda is one of the places where the concept of value-chain development has been successfully adopted. According to Mbowa, Shinyekwa, and Lwanga (2012), since the 1990s, development of the value chain has spurred income growth for about 700,000 dairy farming households, and in addition, has led to job creation for farm input dealers, dairy equipment dealers, dairy ingredient dealers, raw milk traders, milk transporters, mini-dairies, large-scale milk processors, as well as distributors. The International Labor Organization (ILO) value chain development intervention in Sri Lanka implemented between 2005 and 2009 dubbed “Enterprise for Pro-poor Growth (Enter-Growth)”30 was aimed at boosting micro and small enterprises in the flower growing value chain. The intervention impacted about 52,000 micro and small enterprises and resulted in an estimated tripling of household income and 15% increase in employment in businesses in the districts where the intervention took place."

    "text": "4.2 Access to Financial Services\nTo support the potential of value chain development, policymakers should consider incentives for financial institutions to deliver financial services to the underserved segments of the society. One of the main setbacks for lenders is that they do not have information about individuals outside of wage employment. Policymakers can help by implementing sound national identification and registration systems upon which consumer and credit information systems can be developed. Thus, a potentially sound program for employment generation should begin with a registration system that brings everyone into a formal system in a move that is akin to “formalizing the individuals.” Next step is to focus on enterprise finance for the underserved segments, which is in tandem with the development value chains in agriculture.31 One of the secondary benefits of expansion of enterprise capital is that it is likely to induce high-entrepreneur individuals to move from low-wage formal employment (where their entrepreneurial abilities are poorly rewarded) into job creation in the informal sector. Countries where the financial system is more inclusive will have enhanced capacities to generate informal employment."

    "text": "4.3 Skill Development\nIn the absence of unemployment benefits in most developing countries, open unemployment is hardly an attractive option, particularly for unskilled workers. As a result, underemployment becomes a more important issue for workers with little or no education than unemployment. Indeed, contemporary labor market lexicon tends to apply the concept of unemployment in reference to college or vocational training graduates and underemployment in reference to unskilled workers.\nUnskilled workers have little access to support networks compared to educated workers and are driven into doing something by all means.32 These workers also lack skills. Thus, in addition to developing value chains, training and skill development programs must be developed by means of training workers for the needs of the economy. Policymakers should emphasize moving away from general education to more specific skill-oriented training. Efforts to incorporate vocational training early in the education process might create interests in other forms of employment beside white-collar or blue-collar jobs. The International Labor Organization Organization (2008, v) defines effective skill development programs as those “which connect education to technical training, technical training to labor market entry and labor market entry to workplace and lifelong learning.”"

    "text": "4.4 Rural Population Growth\nIt is a stylized fact that natural population growth in rural areas far exceeds the urban rates due largely to differentials in birth rates. Population pressure on rural wages is therefore one of the push factors in urban migration. It is also the case that education, which has become the primary determinant of employment in urban formal sector and mostly available in urban areas, has increased over the years in developing countries. This section analyzes the role of these two concepts on urban unemployment.\nI showed in section 3.3 that as larger fractions of the population are educated, the value of increases on average, so that the urban wage gap increases and therefore voluntary urban unemployment increases. Increase in urban unemployment leads to increase in urban average wage \\(W^a_U\\) but reduction in urban expected wage \\(W^e_U\\). Increase in urban average wage reverses urban-rural migration and increases the rate of unemployment in U4. However, the net effect of increase in education on urban unemployment depends on the rate of population growth, which exerts pressure on the rural wage. A comparison of the relative rates of growth is therefore important.\nIf population growth exceeds the rate of growth of educated workforce, then the rural wage \\(W_R\\) falls faster than the rate at which expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) falls and average urban wage \\(W^a_U\\)increases. In expectation, the income gap between rural and urban worker rises, leading to increase in rural-urban migration and decrease in urban-rural migration. In effect, urban unemployment becomes inflated. On the other hand, if population growth is slower than the rate of growth of education, then the rural wage \\(W_R\\) falls at a slower rate than the rate at which expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) falls and average urban wage \\(W^a_U\\) increases. The consequence is that rural-urban migration slows down and urban-rural migration also slows down. The growth of education supply is inevitable in the 21st century and cannot be scaled down. As a result, the urban unemployment problem would require interventions to reduce rural fertility and population growth."

    "section": "Footnotes",
    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe conventional wisdom among economists that minimum wage creates excess labor especially among low-wage workers has greatly influenced economic policy and continues to be held as a proximate cause of unemployment in developing countries. The main idea is that a legislated wage floor set above market-clearing wage in a labor market induces excess supply of labor and creates unemployment. Although this idea emerged from analyzing a unified standard labor market that is entirely covered by regulations, the idea has been extended to multisector labor markets where some sectors may not be covered by labor regulations.↩︎\nStability of earning streams in urban jobs traditionally makes urban jobs more desirable than rural agricultural employment as the latter is vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and natural disasters. However the reforms that commenced since the 1980s induced layoffs and eroded public sector job stability in many developing countries. Jobs in the private sectors are also no longer stable as in the pre-reform era.↩︎\nIn defense of the authors, the informal sector had not become pronounced at the time their model was written. The urban informal sector did not receive attention until Hart (1971) invented the term while studying urban employment in Ghana.↩︎\nThe view that earnings in agriculture are best described as shared output was first suggested by (Lewis 1954) and emphasized by other authors such as (Fields 2005). Although individuals have different levels of productivity, actual wage do not reflect this.↩︎\nThis classification relies on self-reporting. An individual who self-reports to be unemployed might be engaged in some activities but is actively seeking a job in the formal sector. Other workers engaged in informal activities may also be seeking job opportunities in the formal sector. But as long as these workers are not actively seeking employment, they are classified as informally employed.↩︎\nThrough this medium, rural population pressure induces urban migration by driving rural earnings downward. The differentiation between marginal product and average product for many workers constitutes a “push” which guarantees that a large number of workers would easily migrate to urban areas.↩︎\nThe subcontracting relationships taking place in African countries after the reforms are characteristically different from those that existed in the Asian countries in the 1980s. While the Asian types were aimed at lowering the costs of production of manufactures in the era of export-led growth, those taking place in African countries are essentially for services of unskilled workers in the growing services sector. Firms sub-contract these jobs in order to evade minimum wage laws and other labor regulations that may require paying more wage than they are willing to offer.↩︎\nActually, the author merely quoted (Lewis 1954) description of the urban traditional sector. His reference to a 1954 description when writing in 1969 was likely a demonstration of his obliviousness of the dynamics of the informal sector.↩︎\nMore importantly, because the average migrant worker is more educated now than in the 1970s, a possibility exists that he or she is unlikely to engage in informal activities that uneducated workers are willing to do. This leads to the possibility of voluntary unemployment where workers hold out and continue to find jobs at wages they are willing to accept.↩︎\nUsing the terminology of early US literature on minimum wage Brozen (1962); Welch (1973); Tauchen (1981) this separation into formal and informal sectors is in effect a separation into covered and uncovered sectors. By this classification, all public sector employments are formal since they are covered by government regulations. Thus, all informal activities are part of the private sector. Individuals straddling both formal and informal sectors are counted as employed in the formal sector. Typically, the formal employment is designated as the primary employment.↩︎\nFirms and enterprises sort into formal and informal sector depending on a combination of the costs and benefits related to both capital and regulation. A firm with high levels of capital will choose formality because the benefits of formalizing – the protection and other benefits that come with formality – exceed the costs. A firm with low level of capital will be discouraged from formalizing because the costs are daunting compared to the benefits.↩︎\nEmpirical evidence supports this assumption. Arai (2003) and Viren (2005) provide evidence of a positive relationship between capital-labor ratio and wages.↩︎\nIt is unlikely that informal firms in this category will increase wages in order to prevent their workers from moving to the formal sector where wages are now higher. The reason is that increase in minimum wage is likely to result in layoffs from the formal sector.↩︎\nIn addition, there is anecdotal evidence that the heavy burdens of formality in some countries such as Cameroun cause registered firms to disappear from city blocks into homesteads. This would also suggest some redistribution of firms from formal to informal sectors on account of tightening regulations.↩︎\nThere are possible exceptions to this conventional wisdom. First, in relation to subcontracting, the average worker in the informal sector may earn a lower wage ex-post due to the administrative costs of subcontracting. While the formal firm has a valuation of the worker’s marginal product and is willing to keep the wage unchanged, the cost of transferring the operations to a subcontractor will on balance reduce the actual wage paid to the worker[1]. In this respect, the extent to which informal wage falls in response to an increase in the minimum wage depends on the costs and limits of subcontracting. In the absence of these costs, it is unlikely that informal wage decreases. Second, workers who enter the informal sector to invest their severance compensations are more likely to contribute to raising informal wages because of the capital they bring with them. Third, informal sector wage may rise if workers in the formal sector are the main buyers of the goods produced in the informal sector and their income elasticity of demand for informal output is relatively large (Fiszbein 1992). Fourth, minimum wage increase may be associated with increase in informal wage if the legislation is induced by factors that are external to the economy. In the case of mineral exporting countries, an increase in the world price of the natural resource may lead to expansion of the formal sector concurrently with an increase in minimum wage. The informal sector benefits both through a decrease in labor supply and increased demand for its output. Informal wage may fall for another reason – the influx of migrant workers from the rural areas. However, I demonstrate in this paper that rural-urban migration is not substantially linked to minimum wage increase.↩︎\nUrban to rural migration is commonly referred to as return migration.↩︎\nIndeed, it is unlikely that the resettlement programs in Kenya had any effect on these workers.↩︎\nIn this equation,  may also be interpreted as the likelihood that an individual finds employment in the formal sector, which reflects the difficulty of access to formal jobs. Thus, there is a strong positive correlation between  and  that is described in the next section.↩︎\nConsider an urban-rural migration time derivative  that simply interchanges the rural and urban components of Harris and Todaro (1970) equation (9). Equilibrium conditions would be obtained by equating the two migration streams. Doing so will result in an indeterminate system.↩︎\nThere are some, although in the minority, new entrants to the labor market who do not seek a formal paid job but enter directly into the informal sector. It is plausible to assume that these workers have analyzed the market and have learnt that they would only be able to work in the informal sector.↩︎\nThe parameter can also reflect the way workers in each group measure their likelihood of obtaining formal employment. The distribution of urban labor force therefore reflects self-selection among workers. For example, if education plays a role in formal employment, as it does, conditional on unemployment, an educated worker may be more likely to sort into U2 than the uneducated worker. The reason is that the educated worker will have a higher assessment of  than the uneducated worker. There are two mechanisms that can bring about this sorting. First, individuals may be driven by peer comparison. Unemployed college graduates are likely to be seeking jobs that are comparable to their peers’ in the formal sector. Second, an educated worker is more likely to value employment in terms of lifetime earnings; a strategy of temporary unemployment spell that is succeeded by high wage employment for the remainder of lifetime is preferred to a strategy of low wage employment over the entire lifetime. Estimates of lifetime earnings under the former would have to fall significantly to the level of the latter before the educated worker would accept informal employment immediately\nThe formal sector is not large enough to employ all workers seeking employment there. The job selection process is therefore non-random and allows for discrimination among workers on the basis of skills. Workers arrive at the urban labor market with education which they present as a signal of their skills but employers possess a mechanism by which they make workers to reveal their skills and hire workers whose revealed skills match the desired skills. The revelation mechanism involves employers putting job candidates through written and oral skill tests that allow workers to reveal their skills. It is thus plausible that unemployed educated workers may incorrectly consider themselves as “comparable” to peers employed in the formal sector. Whereas workers acquire education as a signal (means of obtaining formal employment), employers in non-clearing labor markets devise several strategies to extract information about true productivity and hire the most productive workers conditional on signal. This incorrect comparison may induce the unemployed to continue to seek jobs that are comparable with their peers and consider jobs paying lower wages as inferior.↩︎\nThe notion could also apply to workers in U4 who should return to rural areas if they choose to remain in the city. However, I assume that these workers return to rural areas following the wage incentives.↩︎\nThese opportunities will be limited in countries where there are strict laws regulating property rights, street trading, squatting and the use of public places and the environment. In those settings unemployment will be largely involuntary. The reverse is of course the case in developing countries where such laws do not exist, or they exist but are not enforced.↩︎\nTypically, the fraction of the rural population that declares open unemployment is very negligible.↩︎\n Inclusion of a separate group of rural unemployed workers does not add any insight to the discussion.↩︎\n[1] The main policy conclusions reached by Harris and Todaro (1970) can also be reached in this setting. Reading from the left side of equation (9), the net flow of workers between the rural sector and the urban sector differ under different regimes. In response to an increase in rural wage, the incentive to migrate among rural workers (captured in the numerator) decreases by exactly the same extent as the incentive for return migration among urban workers (captured in the denominator) increases. In effect, an additional job that becomes available in the rural sector (which reduces the incentive to migrate) is matched by exactly an urban worker that returns to the rural sector. This results in a decrease in urban unemployment. On the other hand, in response to an increase in urban formal wage, the incentive for urban migration among rural workers (captured by the numerator) increases by more than the incentive for return migration among urban unemployed workers (captured by the denominator) decreases. Interpreted along the same line, an additional job that is created in urban sector (which reduces incentive for return migration) is matched by more than one rural-urban migrant worker. Since only one worker can have the job, the unmatched migrant worker(s) will add to the urban unemployment pool.↩︎\nWorkers who move from the urban informal sector to rural sector as a result of the increase in agricultural wage do not contribute to the urban unemployment metric as they simply move from urban employment into rural employment. Rather, the change in urban unemployment is driven solely by return to rural agriculture among workers in state US4.↩︎\nThe efficacy of rural development as the cure for urban unemployment is further challenged by the extent of education. The urban bias among educated population could mean that unemployment is dominantly of the voluntary type where returning to the village is not an option.↩︎\nUsing the example of grain, Fafchamps (1999) observes that “In a typical Western country, grain is purchased from farmers by a large corporation, e.g., Cargill, processed in the corporation facilities, and sold to supermarkets and agribusinesses, who sell to final consumers. There are very few intermediaries between producer and consumer, and the size of each individual market transaction is very large. In contrast, grain in Africa is first purchased from a myriad of small farmers by collecting agents, assembled for shipment by a rural wholesaler, purchased by an urban wholesaler or processor, to be sold to retailers and, finally, micro-retailers. (p.7)↩︎\nDetails can be accessed at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---ifp_seed/documents/publication/wcms_175475.pdf↩︎\nThe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) of the New Partnership for Africa Development (NEPAD) designates value chains in agriculture and access to financial services as one of the core strategies under Pillar II.↩︎\nThere has been an argument about whether to classify individuals engaged in peasant activities such as street hawking and sporadic labor in urban areas as informally employed or to consider them as unemployed. There is now a consensus that those individuals are simply underemployed. Peasant activity is considered a form of employment for two reasons. First, an individual selling one stick of pen at a time is considered as working because a market exists for the retail activity: there are individuals who are unable to purchase a box of pen at a time but are only able to buy one stick at a time. The same applies to petty retail traders. Second, individuals would prefer to do those types of work rather than doing nothing because they can demonstrate to their urban support network that they are making effort to work. This is akin to work test in unemployment insurance in advanced societies.↩︎"

    "text": "Why Research?\nThe essence of research is knowledge production, or betterstill, discovery of the world around us. There are two reasons why anyone would want to do or fund research. One, we want to understand how our societies work. Studies spurred by this motive are basic in nature and are more often than not theoretical. Second, we want answers to specific questions. Such research is termed applied research. These questions are typically causal in nature and are of two types: those seeking to establish the direction of causation, asking whether increase in a variable causes increase in another, and those seeking to estimate the exact causal effect of one variable on the other. However, in general, applied research tends to take the form of the latter; the sponsors of a research are likely to be interested not merely in how a variable affects another but by how much? This latter question is usually harder to answer than the former.\nIn observing the world around us through data, the researcher seeks to discover the data generating process (DGP) of a particular outcome – what are the important determinants, what are their independent effects, how do they interact to produce the outcome we observe and what is the best way to describe or model this process? This is the crucial knowledge that feeds policymaking! This is the knowledge we require – regarding important issues – if we are going to change the society and our world. Until we can demonstrate that we understand the process correctly and can distinguish it from alternative processes, it is not clear that research can be useful in our contexts. If we do not understand the society, we cannot help it or change it in a meaningful and targeted way. The alternative is to rely on pure luck! The problem is that luck does not run very far. Having grand ideas and desires does not matter; if we cannot discover the DGP, we have not done anything useful.\nThe Place of Data\nIt is an obvious fact that no nation can produce sound and rigorous research (and science in general) more than it collects good data. Quality and comprehensive datasets allow people to observe, think, model and remodel, discover the society through produce credible evidence, and solve relevant problems. I don’t see how we can do rigorous economic research in the absence of good data! It goes without saying that the first step to accelerate knowledge production is to invest in data collection.\nBe that as it may, there is an additional problem with data collection. It is futile from hindsight to collect data in ways that abstract from society. It is rather appalling that development institutions would sponsor data collection and in the questionnaires ignore basic features of society. For example, it is well understood that the basic sphere of resource allocation and public good sharing in African societies is not the household but the extended family. Taking the nuclear household or the set of people residing within the walls of a building as constituting the entire sphere of decision making and resource allocation is simply silly. One would be looking at one of the leaking pots that are contained in a much bigger and well sealed pot. Despite the plethora of anthropological evidence to this effect, the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Surveys were designed in ways that view an African household as organized in ways similar to an American household. My most recent survey of datasets across Africa led me to only one place – the Agincourt Demographic and Health Surveillance surveys in Northern Province in South Africa – where interhousehold connections were deemed important. Viewing households in developing societies as independent economic units is just not consistent with what anthropologists have showed us!\nSocial Contexts in Research\nDefining economics as what economists do, economic research aims to generate or refine knowledge about allocation of scarce resources and the efficiency of specified allocations. Of course, economic activities do not take place in vacuum. Resource allocation is importantly characterized by the structure of incentives – opportunities and constraints reflected in the costs and benefits – inherent in the institutional setting, and these institutions could vary from one social context to another. There is a tendency, which I think is dangerous, to ignore social contexts in the pursuit of knowledge about issues that we consider as economic in nature. Because the data do not reflect society, such research efforts however grand they are will only produce “knowledge you can’t use.”\nThis realization brings with it two important implications. Of course I have assumed that the focus of inquiry is important for welfare improvement. First, the researcher needs to carefully observe society, ask initial questions on the subject of interest, and probe deeply to have a fair idea of the process that the research is aiming to uncover. Second, research does not necessarily have to begin with writing an introduction and literature review of a subject. Most often than not, influential research does not begin with getting buried into the books and papers! Sometimes, the question that a researcher initially thinks is important will end up as unimportant after asking questions about the society. For example, a researcher could be interested in improving the lives of a rural agricultural population where cattle and wood exist but cattle-driven ploughs are non-existent. The researcher could then embark on an inquiry about efficiency of cattle market: the idea that a market for cattle could allow farmers to buy cattle to create ploughs which in turn will help raise productivity and raise welfare. Suppose cattle are only given as bride price at the time of marriage and cattle trade is forbidden according to the norms. If the researcher takes time to ask questions from the people what they do with cattle and wood, and why they use cattle for bride-price and not for other means, he will quickly discover that a cattle market is a non-issue in the village and perhaps must ask a different question. Omitting this important step is akin to “putting the cart before the horse.”\nRuling Paradigm\nA typical research paper produced in indigenous African university or research institution follows more or less a rigid structure. The paper begins with framing the issue and discussing its relevance to humanity in the introduction, the literature search, the statement of the problem, the objectives of the research which are translated into corresponding hypotheses to be tested, a litany of existing models collected from around the globe and final selection of one of them to be used for the purpose of the paper, the research methodology, the data, empirical results, summary and conclusion. In fact, materials contained in the sections beginning from introduction to methodology constitute the research proposal. Once the data is acquired and analyzed, the only thing left is to append the statistical test results and the inferences to be made from them. The paper is done!\nThe process outlined also has a history. Until recently when the need to understand societies began to gain traction, most research and training programs were almost exclusively focused on macroeconomic topics such as inflation, interest rate, trade, balance of payments, and unemployment to mention a few. Indeed, the focus on macroeconomics topics were driven by data that were available and well known as well as dependence on knowledge generated from developed countries. Data sets analyzed were typically time series for studies of national phenomenon and multiple countries’ time series for studies of regional phenomenon. Since most macroeconomic concepts are typically thought to conform to standard models, there are no reasons why standard macroeconomic models that have been tested somewhere in the developed world should not be the ones applicable in the developing world. Minor distinctions or minor adjustments could be made to models while applying them elsewhere. For example, a model suited to large countries might require some slight adjustment when applied to small countries.\nAcademic training followed the knowledge dependence hypothesis where knowledge flowed from the developed world to the developing world. Most of early faculties in African institutions were trained in the west; indeed this was quite common before the cold war. Colonial masters typically sent indigene Africans abroad for doctoral training and brought them back home to help train others. It is also the case that most of those trained this way were trained mainly in the methods of macroeconomic thinking.\nThis style of doing macroeconomic research has been transported into microeconomic research. As a result, students are boxed into a corner in such a way that it is often hard to make new discoveries. I had a chance to supervise master’s students at Witwatersrand, and this is what I observed. About eight in ten of students wanted to write their thesis on topics like “the socioeconomic determinants of ….” I got tired of it and jokingly asked one student who told them that is what they should be doing? Are those theses going to inform any kind of serious decision-making? I agree they were good topics in the 1980s and even now, but these days we want to know the causal effect of important factors. We want to know what we don’t know yet! We just don’t want to rerun a model that has been run in India in Zambia. I think these are serious issues that are worth considering. How do we get out of working on safe topics that the process can allow us to examine? I understand that they are forced into those topics by the dissertation process.\nWhat has changed?\nData collection efforts at microeconomic levels have proliferated greatly since the end of the cold war, and this development has marked a great shift toward empirical microeconomic research. The proliferation of datasets comes with another development. These data shed insights into problems with inferences previously made about several phenomena that were not recognized then. For instance, the issue of selection was not widely recognized until James Heckman published a paper in 1979. Even sociologists now are more prone to mention the word “selection” than economists are. Indeed, as more datasets became available, many empirical problems that were previously unrecognized began to gain recognition and econometrics advanced rapidly. As a result, the task of establishing that you have made a discovery is far more daunting1. In fact, the more important task is not about trying to establish the idea you think you have found, but to fend off and rule out other potential interpretations of the findings. No one will believe that a serious contribution has been made until those alternative interpretations have been shut down. Now, all those alternative interpretations arise from theoretical or econometric reasoning. If a researcher knows that what is most important in the paper is the evidence and that the entire writing will make no meaning unless there is a clear demonstration that credible evidence has been found, it is clear that spending time on literature before looking at the data is not the wise way to spend research time. In fact, if I know that the quality of the paper depends more importantly on the evidence than anything else, then I should establish the evidence before doing anything else.\nMore than anything else,availability of new data should lead to breaking new grounds. These new data, if well inspected, could provide insights into breaks with the past in ways that have not been previously understood. It is hard to break new grounds if one must always begin with the past. Indeed, the idea that research must begin with the literature and existing models, after framing the issue has a potential flaw. First, some good research papers and discoveries prop up by unintentionally stumbling on something! It’s not even the issue that the researcher has thought about! Second, burying one’s head into the literature and existing models may actually keep a person squarely inside the box and unable to get out! In this case, it’s counterproductive to begin there! The idea of writing a model before the research is done is the single most important problem from my viewpoint! Unless one is writing a theoretical paper or doing an empirical test of an existing theory or (repeat) testing a theory that was tested in Finland in Ghana, I am not sure that existing theories are the first place to go. Let’s think of this. If a model fitted data from the Peruvian society, what is the basis for being the model that should fit the Malawian society? Unless the researcher allows himself to think more intensely about Malawi, and this is possible only by examining data from Malawi, it is more likely that the very important thing that distinguishes Malawi from Peru (except significance or differences in the size of coefficient estimates) will be lost! What the researcher needs to discover in Malawi would have been given away.\nOne thing that I also think has changed is the purpose of research. Research can be done with the intention of racking up articles and demonstrating one’s productivity and mastery of skills, or with the intention of changing the world. The economics profession (as practiced in North America) seems to have decided largely for the former. I think this shift is informed by failure of the policies they have advanced in the past, particularly relating to development, that have fallen flat! I think that failure was admitted in a flawed way. I remember when I went to Yale, the professors made clear that they do not intend to advise governments on what to do. That is, they are just doing their things. If you attend development conferences, you’ll realize that these folks are not interested in changing the world; they just want to enjoy what they are doing and become experts in their fields. But we learn some things from their works. That viewpoint has created problems for those with the latter intention. They must demonstrate that they can do the same thing as those professionals before their evidence can be taken seriously. It is either you are there or you are out!\nBeware of Tyranny\nThe most important danger to policymaking is the “tyranny of dead ideas.” Before the recent advances in the tools of econometric analysis, the foremost development economists simply observed events, imagined what could be the explanation according to economic theories and laid down new theories that have become the rules of the thumb. In a lot of ways, these rules are just taken as settled. For example, there is a rule that says a country must have high inequalities in order to grow. But of course we have just witnessed unprecedented rate of inequality in an economy that has had enviable long run growth. Despite the experiences, this rule is virtually repeated as true almost in any study of inequality, whether in developed or developing economies. The troubling part of it is that the rule is cited without reference to the social and policy environment that produced those outcomes.\nThe role of mentoring\nIf someone comes up to me and describes an empirical research interest, the first thing I ask the student is why it’s an important question. After this, the next thing I ask it for the student to write down the idea in terms of an econometric model and define the variables on both sides of the equation (I don’t say go and write an introduction and literature review). The next thing is to help think through the implications of potential findings and the alternative interpretations of such findings, and how to deal with the various empirical issues. That discussion and understanding of the various issues the individual has to contend with are the guides for data search. If appropriate data does not exist (sometimes administrative and survey datasets could be combined) for the purpose, then it is important to set on the journey of collecting data.\nOf course, the process outlined in the preceding paragraph requires that I stay current with the literature in the area in which I am advising a student! It requires that I know the issues and can easily refer the student to how those issues have been explored. Perhaps, this is where the problem lies. If I don’t know where the cutting edge is, I cannot guide the student this way and I have to send him to the old school.\nThe danger of the old school\nOn another note, there are different types of research and different types of research outputs. For some outputs, readers want to know the entire work from reading the introduction. They have tons of papers to read! So, if I have to write an introduction before seeing the data, then I must be prepared to write it again after seeing the data because the paper will not be read if they can’t understand the entire work from the introduction. If I wrote the model before looking at the data (except the case where I’m just testing an existing model), then I must be prepared to rewrite the model that fits the data once I’m done understanding the data. This writing and rewriting can just lengthen the process of graduating and create redundancies.\nRecommendation\nBefore a student is asked to submit a dissertation proposal, there is a need to allow for a sketchy pre-dissertation proposal, exploratory study that may involve travel and initial interviews on an area of interest. This stage allows the student to gain insight into how the society is organized and what are the important characteristics that may affect the subject of interest. The student thereafter develops a dissertation proposal and search for relevant and suitable data. In the event that the data available are unsuitable, the candidate goes ahead to design a survey based on the findings during the pre-dissertation phase."

    "text": "The essence of research is knowledge production, or betterstill, discovery of the world around us. There are two reasons why anyone would want to do or fund research. One, we want to understand how our societies work. Studies spurred by this motive are basic in nature and are more often than not theoretical. Second, we want answers to specific questions. Such research is termed applied research. These questions are typically causal in nature and are of two types: those seeking to establish the direction of causation, asking whether increase in a variable causes increase in another, and those seeking to estimate the exact causal effect of one variable on the other. However, in general, applied research tends to take the form of the latter; the sponsors of a research are likely to be interested not merely in how a variable affects another but by how much? This latter question is usually harder to answer than the former.\nIn observing the world around us through data, the researcher seeks to discover the data generating process (DGP) of a particular outcome – what are the important determinants, what are their independent effects, how do they interact to produce the outcome we observe and what is the best way to describe or model this process? This is the crucial knowledge that feeds policymaking! This is the knowledge we require – regarding important issues – if we are going to change the society and our world. Until we can demonstrate that we understand the process correctly and can distinguish it from alternative processes, it is not clear that research can be useful in our contexts. If we do not understand the society, we cannot help it or change it in a meaningful and targeted way. The alternative is to rely on pure luck! The problem is that luck does not run very far. Having grand ideas and desires does not matter; if we cannot discover the DGP, we have not done anything useful."
