## Abstract

**Background:** Unplanned pregnancy is a public health problem in Nigeria, which affects millions of women worldwide. Providing long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods is an excellent strategy, but uptake remains low. The aim of this study was to investigate use of LARC use by women in Nigeria.

**Methods:** A search of two electronic databases (PubMed and Embase) was conducted between December 2020 and January 2021 according to PRISMA guidelines. In addition, grey literature and reports identified. The narrative review focused on awareness and access to LARCs, effectiveness and discontinuation, and policies and programs.

**Results:** A total of 130 studies were included in our study following the full-text screening. These were supplemented with plus 12 reports from websites and organizations.

**Conclusion:** This systematic scoping review is the first, to the best of our knowledge, long-acting reversible contraception use in Nigeria. This scoping review emphasizes the pressing need for research to explore prevalence and factors affecting discontinuation of LARCs.
