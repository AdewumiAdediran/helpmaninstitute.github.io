    "section": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:",
    "text": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:\nThe Knowledge of long-acting reversible contraception was relatively low in comparison with other Sub-Saharan African countries; nevertheless, there have been remarkable improvement. (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019). For instance, in 2003, only 27 percent of Nigerian women had heard of IUDs, 57 percent of Injectables and 10 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004) . Nonetheless, by 2018, 46 percent of women had heard of IUDs, 82 percent of Injectables and 70 percent of Implants (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019).\nAwareness of LARCs varied with geographical location, wealth quintile and education levels. Women living in rural, and less literate North East and North West zones were least likely to be informed on any method of long-acting contraception (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019).  In contrast, women residing in urban Southern regions, (especially South West) were well-educated on the different LARCs available to them . Expectedly, low levels of education and household income led to reduced knowledge and awareness of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019).\nWomen obtained information on LARCs from various sources. Primarily, such information were from friends and family (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Ameh and Sule 2007; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Secondary sources include: radio/television/newspapers/magazines, school lectures/workshops/seminars and health workers (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Monjok et al. 2010; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olukoya 1991; Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005). This is interesting because first, it indicates the importance of ensuring that non-medical personnel have access to the right information on LARCs since most women are more likely to get their foremost information from informal sources (Olukoya 1991). Second, it also suggests that organizing community-directed outreaches centered on raising awareness and providing information on LARCs to community members may yield notable results since women are more inclined to learn about LARCs primarily from their immediate community (Olukoya 1991).\nIn a slightly different pattern, female students sourced their information on LARCs primarily from social media, lectures, seminars, friends, family and secondarily, from health workers (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). This may probably be due to the academic environment (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). The positive effect of this observation lies in the potential of increased awareness through seminar, workshops and social media adverts (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Copper T, Depo Provera®, Noristerat® and Implanon® were the most popular brands of LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012) among female students. Female students who had previous induced abortion were significantly more knowledgable about LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012).  Their experience of an induced abortion may have triggered the quest to obtain information on more effective and reliable ways of preventing unplanned pregnancies (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Parents often feel uncomfortable communicating issues bothering sex or in some cases, lack adequate information on LARCs. As a result, young females are more reluctant to get information on LARCs from them (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005).\nDifferent studies had contrasting views on the influence of religion on the knowledge of LARCs. Some studies reported the effect of religious beliefs on the knowledge, awareness and subsequent use of LARCs. For instance, Christian women were reportedly more aware of LARCs than women belonging to other religions in Nigeria (Ayangade, 1984; Egede et al., 2015; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Olaleye et al., 2014; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011). However, this maybe not be a true reflection nationally, as due cognizance must be taken of a possible confounding of Christianity being the predominant religion in the regions of some of these studies (Adeyemi et al., 2008; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; Ugboaja et al., 2011).  In contrast, two studies conducted by Aduloju et al  in 2021, and Orji and Odimegwu in 2002 (2021; 2002) stated that religion, did not have any statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05) on the knowledge and awareness of LARCs.\nThe gap between the Knowledge of LARCs and its actual usage was widen (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; Olusegun et al., 2012; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002). The implication of this is that awareness alone does not determine the utilization of LARCs by Nigerian women (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; Olusegun et al., 2012; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002). The common reasons for this gap include: lack of knowledge on provider centers, distance from the source of LARCs, adequate information on the benefits of LARCs, fear of possible side effects, fear of the procedure, husband disapproval, religion and culture (Aduloju et al., 2021; Olusegun et al., 2012; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001) Figure 2: Knowledge of LARC methods   \nSource: NDHS 2003, NDHS 2008, NDHS 2013 & NDHS 2018\nThe acceptance and use of LARCs was largely dependent on the attitude of women (Aduloju et al., 2021). Women’s attitude (positive or negative) towards LARCs was primarily determined by their level of education and number of surviving children (especially sons). Improvement in health, maintenance of a smaller family size and the fact that it made life more comfortable steered a positive attitude in women which made them four times more likely to use LARCs (Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015). Some women frowned at LARCs because they viewed regulating their fertility as an unhealthy immoral behavior which is an affront to the God-given blessing of fertility (Renne, 1997; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ukaegbu, 1977)\nAnother contributing factor to the attitude of the women to LARCs was the viewpoint of health workers. For instance, although family planning and health workers may promote the use of LARCs like IUDs, some do so with reservations, advising women not to use IUDs if they have not had children before (Renne, 1997)."

    "section": "3.3 Access to LARCs",
    "text": "3.3 Access to LARCs\nNigerian women seek long-acting reversible contraception from both public and private sectors (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Government hospitals, government health centers and family planning clinics were major public health outlets for LARCs  (Egede et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). While family/private hospital/clinics and private pharmacies, popularly called “chemist shops” were popular private sector outlets (Ayangade, 1984; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARCs such as IUDs, Implants, and Injectables were primarily sourced from the public sector because they require trained service delivery (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nThe ease of accessing LARCs, proximity of service providers and level of confidentiality offered by service providers were key considerations in choosing where to get LARCs, given that some women used LARCs without their husband’s knowledge or approval (Egede et al., 2015)(Onwujekwe et al., 2013). Patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops being the most proximate and accessible providers were the major sources of LARCs that do not require trained medical services.\nReligion and denomination also influenced the source of purchase. Reported that while Roman Catholics purchase LARCs chiefly from patent medicine shops, the majority of other Christians procure theirs from general hospitals (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). The patronage of patent medicine shops by Catholics maybe associated with a religious objection to the use of modern contraceptive methods and the desire to keep their purchase of LARCs “confidential.” Similarly, Muslims patronized patent medicine shops more frequently, also due to reported high disapproval by of contraceptives (Egede et al., 2015; Onwujekwe et al., 2013; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005).\nFigure 3: Source of LARCs (Public Sector)\nSource: NDHS 2018\nFigure 4: Source of LARCs (Private Sector)                                                                                                          \nSource: NDHS, 2018\nThere were geographical differences in accessing LARCs. Urban dwellers procured LARCs from government hospitals, private clinics, and pharmacy shops with qualified pharmacists (Onwujekwe et al., 2013). In contrast, rural dwellers got theirs mostly from patent medicine dealers (Onwujekwe et al., 2013), probably due to the proximity of these patent medicine shops and high cost transportation from rural to urban regions where bigger health facilities are located. This trend of the patent medicine shops being the most popular source of LARCs in rural regions is worrisome, since most of the patent medicine dealers are untrained (Monjok et al., 2010) .\nMost women held the opinion that LARCs were not easily accessible (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). However, the proportion of women who thought that LARCs were not readily accessible decreased consistently with increase in educational status and residence in urban areas (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). Hence, one can infer that with exposure to education, women become well informed on the various means of accessing LARCs and are financially capable of purchasing them.\nAlthough a good number of Nigerian women desire them (The RESPOND Project, 2013), there are certain barriers to accessing the wide variety of LARCs available. First, is the reduced availability of LARCs in certain family planning clinics (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The RESPOND project, reported feedback by one of the service providers where she buttressed this challenge:\n“..Sometimes we run out of stock but not too frequently; when that happens, I will go into the market to get some so that we will have the methods, because we are mindful of our clients’ appointment dates…. I used to tell the community that the IUD is now costly because we used to get it from black market in Makurdi…” (The RESPOND Project, 2013)\n —Service provider, Adikpo, Benue State, Nigeria\nThe lack of basic supplies and equipment most often lead providers to charge unauthorized fees that some women cannot afford or request clients to purchase LARC supplies from the black market notorious for its uncertain quality (The RESPOND Project, 2013). Second, some family planning clinics are in a poor state of repair, and many had either no or only intermittent electricity all of which discourages women (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nThe third barrier to accessing LARCs is the shortage of skilled providers to deliver LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). For instance, although the policy that permits Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to deliver Injectables was approved in 2012, only few CHEWs have received formal training on how to deliver the method properly (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Regarding other LARCs, Implants were introduced on a larger scale in the public sector only in 2006, and it is plausible that many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public system (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Many experienced Family Planning (FP) providers cited the lack of continuing education and training as the reason for the rather reduced skill set in administering LARCs, pointing to the 1980s as the last time that large-scale FP training efforts were in place (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014)."

    "section": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence",
    "text": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence\nThe contraceptive prevalence (CPR) of LARCs remain low relative to other short-acting contraceptives. Nevertheless, the CPR of LARCs increased steadily from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 7.4 percent in 2018 among married women using contraceptives (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Nationally, about 14.8 percent of women currently using any method of contraception used LARCs (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020). The prevalence LARCs was highest among women aged 35 years and above and lowest among those aged 15-24 (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Injectables and IUDs were the most frequently used LARC (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Okunlola et al., 2006, 2009; Onwuhafua et al., 2005; Ozumba & Ibekwe, 2001; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011)\n\nUse of LARCs varied with residence, region, level of education, number of living children, and economic status of the household (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Married women residing in urban areas were more likely to use LARCs than their rural counterparts (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Onwuhafua et al., 2005). The limited use of LARCs in rural areas persists for various reasons ranging from unavailability of the LARC methods to lack of proﬁciency in administering LARCs by rural care providers (Onwuhafua et al., 2005). The South-West zone had the highest proportion of women using LARCs, followed by the South-South zone (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The lowest proportion of married women using any LARC method were in the North-East (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARC use increased with educational attainment across all geopolitical zones (Adeyemi et al., 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). By wealth quintile, women in the lowest quintile were least likely to use long-acting reversible contraception and women in the highest quintile were most likely to use them (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nUse of LARCs was relatively low among singles compared to married women (Ijarotimi et al., 2015; Olaleye et al., 2014; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). This may be because single women are less likely to source for contraception openly because of cultural and religious prohibition of premarital sex in Nigeria (Ijarotimi et al., 2015).\n\n\nThe uptake of LARCs increased with parity; women do not begin to use LARCs until they have had at least one child (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; Konje et al., 1998; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Udigwe et al., 2002).\nAn attribute pointing to the reproductive need of women with less than 3 children and the popular consideration of LARC methods as an alternative to the sterilization method (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ijarotimi et al., 2015).\nThe most common reasons for using any method of long-acting reversible contraception were safety, reversibility, effectiveness, long-term protection, convenience, husband’s approval, understanding of the LARC method, personal choice, the desire to have good maternal health, satisfaction with information given on insertion procedure and services rendered by the healthcare provider recommendation by another woman who had used the method, affordability, approval by religion and duration of the desired LARC (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015; Ojo et al., 2020; ‘Views on Family Planning and Long-Acting and Permanent Methods’, 2013).\nLack of knowledge, not being married, fear of the procedure, dislike of foreign body, inability to access LARCs, husband’s objection, fear of side effects/complications, fear of infertility, need for further counselling, high cost of LARCs, preference for natural methods, lack of knowledge on provider centers, inadequate information on the benefits of LARCs, conﬂicts with their religious and cultural beliefs were the major reasons given by the women for not using LARCs (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015; Eke & Alabi-Isama, 2011; Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Ikechebelu et al., 2005; Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; Konje et al., 1998; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Ojo et al., 2020; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Onwuhafua et al., 2005; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011; Ukaegbu, 1977). In their study, Eke & Alabi-Isama (2011) reported that most adolescent females thought that LARCs should not be used by unmarried women. \nMost women thought that negotiating and deciding with their husbands prior the use of any LARC method was necessary (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; The RESPOND Project, 2013). But in reality, men alone played the dominant role in women’s decision to adopt long-acting reversible contraception and in the choice of method (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The dominant role of men affected the use of LARCs because men generally demonstrated less favorable attitudes toward family planning than women and were less knowledgeable about LARCs (The RESPOND Project, 2013). Hence, a woman’s ability to control her fertility and her choice of long-acting reversible contraception were partly determined by her empowerment status and self-image (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). A woman who is unable to control her life may be less likely to feel she can make and carry out decisions about her fertility (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nDepo Provera® and Noristerat® were the most commonly used brands of Injectables (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Depo Provera® was largely used by women in the South-East and North-West zones, while Noristerat® was primarily used by women in the North-East (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Notably, Depo Provera was the brand of choice for women in the lowest, second and fourth wealth quintile, who had either secondary, primary or no education (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Conversely, the use of Noristerat® increased with educational attainment and wealth status (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014).\nOvertime, the use of Implants, particularly Implanon® and Jadelle® became popular (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Tunau et al., 2019). It even seems that Implants have slowly replaced IUDs which were commonly used earlier (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Tunau et al., 2019). Highly educated women preferred Implants and had higher odds of using them the less educated counterparts. The plausible motive for this preference maybe the increased capacity to manage information correctly by educated women and awareness of the associated advantages of using Implants education provides (Ojo et al., 2020). Non-literate women appeared to be suspicious of new methods and therefore shunned the method (Mutihir & Duru, 2008). Specifically, young Nigerian women with desire for future fertility formed significant proportion of Implanon® acceptors (Roberts et al., 2015).\nIUDs are quite common and widely used in Nigeria, particularly by older married women aged 35 and above (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005) but are gradually losing their appeal. They were least commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Religious constraints seem to be the major propeller behind this; Muslim women while not considering family planning as un-Islamic, often view the insertion of an external object into their body to be sacrilegious (Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984).  Although still used in other regions in Nigeria, IUDs are gradually losing favor in the South-Western region (Ameh & Sule, 2007; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The need for their husband’s consent maybe one of the primary reasons for the general decline in the application of IUDs. The thread from the IUDs often give women away when using them without their husband’s consent (F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005). The most common reason for discontinuation was a desire for pregnancy, especially among those younger than 35 years (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). Married women were more likely to use IUDs than singles, as most singles opt for other forms of contraception (E. C. Ezugwu et al., 2020).\nNigerian women are most often not aware or have misconceptions on the benefits and side effects of long-acting reversible contraception (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). Hence, the need to heighten awareness, to enable women make informed decisions while choosing a LARC method. Women who used injectables and IUDs were more informed on the side effects of these methods, what to do if they experienced side effects and other methods of long-acting contraception available to them than women who opted for Implants (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARC users were least likely to receive information about side effects or safety issues from a private medical facility than from a government hospital (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The same was true of information on what to do if they experienced side effects. (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nAlthough some women were not current users, they indicated interest in using Injectables and IUDs in the future (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The proportion of Nigerian women who were non-users, but intend to use a modern method of contraception (such as LARCs) in the future was lowest in the North-East. This was the same for uneducated women living in rural areas (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013).  Knowledge of this is crucial in order to meet the rising demand for LARCs by Nigerian women. These statistics confirm that demand generation will be a critical component of meeting the national contraceptive prevalence goal (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Concerning the household wealth-index, women from poor households (lowest and second wealth quintiles) subscribed less to the different LARC methods compared to women from middle and wealthy households (middle, fourth and highest wealth quintiles) (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Women aged 25 years and above were more likely to use a LARC method compared to women aged 15–24 years (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Additionally, women who had 1–4 children subscribed further to LARC methods as opposed to women with no children (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020) (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011)."

    "section": "3.6 Effectiveness",
    "text": "3.6 Effectiveness\nGenerally, LARCs were found to be a highly effective method of birth control, with several studies reporting no accidental pregnancies (Pearl index= 0) (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Aisien, 2007; Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Balogun et al., 2014; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Farr et al., 1996; Ladipo et al., 1993; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; Roberts et al., 2015). While there were a few reports of unintended pregnancies, the failure rate was very minimal, ranging from 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Chigbu et al., 2010; Enyindah et al., 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2010; Obi & Anya, 2000; Ojule et al., 2010). Although a relatively high failure rate of 3.7 percent was reported among IUD users in Abia State (Chigbu et al., 2010), unexpected pregnancy was observed in just one out of the 27 IUD users. Larger studies, however, revealed that IUDs, particularly Copper T-380A, were effective in over 99 percent of users (Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Farr et al., 1996; Obi & Anya, 2000). Similar high rates were found among users of progesterone-only injectables, notably Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Chigbu et al., 2010; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012) and Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), and contraceptive subdermal implants, such as Implanon® (Balogun et al., 2014; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2015) Jadelle® (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011)  and Norplant® (Aisien, 2007; Ladipo et al., 1993; Mutihir et al., 2010). A study in Jos reported one failure (3.3 percent) among 30 women who requested for and had Implanon® rods removed (Mutihir & Nyango, 2010). However, this failure was due to inadvertent insertion of the implant during pregnancy.\n3.6 Safety Profile and Complications\nWhile LARCs were generally reported to be safe, the chief complaints were menstrual abnormalities (Adaji et al., 2005; Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014; Chigbu et al., 2010; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Falase et al., 1989; Farr et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2006; Obi & Anya, 2000; Ojule et al., 2010; Okunlola et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2015). Secondary amenorrhea was the most prevalent menstrual disturbance among women using progesterone-only injectables (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah et al., 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Okunlola et al., 2006; Sagay et al., 2008) and reported to a lesser extent by users of IUDs (Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Okunlola et al., 2009) and subdermal implants (Balogun et al., 2014; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Roberts et al., 2015). One study in Enugu, however, reported amenorrhea as the main side effect experienced by Jadelle® users (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011). Other menstrual disturbances associated with the use of LARCs include irregular bleeding, heavy/prolonged bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Also frequently reported complaints were lower abdominal pain (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Aisien, 2007; Chigbu et al., 2010; Enyindah et al., 2012; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012; Okunlola et al., 2009) and vaginal discharge. Breast pain was also reported with the use of implants (Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014). There were also considerable cases of weight gain (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Chigbu et al., 2010; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012) and a far lesser proportion of weight loss (Chigbu et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2012) among women using contraceptive injectables. Interestingly, there were a few reports of weight gain in users of IUDs and Implant, with one study in Jos reporting an average weight gain of 2.6kg among users of Copper T-380A (Mutihir et al., 2006). Meanwhile, Sagay et al. suggested that Norplant tends to prolong PR and QRS electrocardiogram intervals (Sagay et al., 2008). Similarly, hypertension was associated with the use of injectables (Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Hu et al., 2012; Ojule et al., 2010), though report. Expulsion and missing IUDs were also reported in a few studies(Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Obi & Anya, 2000; Okunlola et al., 2009).\n3.7 Barriers to use of LARCs\nShortage of skilled providers to deliver available LARC services is a major barrier to the uptake of LARCs. As stated earlier, only few approved CHEWs have actually received formal training on delivering injectables (i.e., providing the necessary counselling, screening for pregnancy, and delivering the actual injection) [29]. In the North, women rely on CHEWs with at least two years of post-secondary school education as the primary point of care (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). In addition to their primary responsibility in delivering LARCs, these CHEWs often function as the sole staff members of Primary Health Care Centers, providing all the care in the community and sometimes delivering services for which they are not properly trained (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). As at October 2018, 65 percent of Nigerian health facilities have a LARC-trained service provider (Bietsch et al., 2020). But only 36 percent of these facilities provided LARCs to women at the same period. This shortage maybe because many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public sector or that commodities, tool and job aids for delivering services are unavailable (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nSome studies indicated that many service providers contributed to barriers to uptake by restricting access, based on their personal cultural/social norms or client’s personal characteristics (i.e. age, parity, and marital status) (Camara et al., 2017; Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). A 2017 study which reviewed restrictions to contraceptive access imposed by service providers (nurses/midwives, patent and proprietary medicine vendors, CHEWs and pharmacists), showed that service preferences were given to clients who were married or older than 24yrs (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). Similarly, the performance monitoring for action (PMA) 2020’s Adolescents and Young Adults Health Brief indicated that unmarried individuals might be able to services for male condoms and emergency contraceptives – but are less likely to access same for LARCs (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). As a result, unmarried individuals might choose not to use LARCs or opt for methods that are more likely accessible but less effective (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). The unavailability of adequate youth-friendly Family Planning service points may be the biggest factor in preventing adolescents from accessing LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nAnother salient barrier to the uptake of LARCs which has most often been over-looked is the poor integration of family planning services (including LARCs) with maternal and new-born health, childhood immunization, nutrition programmes and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Although during pregnancy, women may not actively seek FP information or services, but they often engage proactively with the healthcare system during antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and ﬁrst year infant immunizations (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). These contact points offer valuable and reliable opportunities for healthcare providers to educate the women on LARC services. Some of the challenges of integration of FP with Maternal and Newborn & Child Health (MNCH) include resistance within the separate health programme responsible for FP and Maternal and Child Health services, facility or community-based workers who are not trained or have inadequate staff time to address both MNCH and FP needs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nIncreased stock-outs of commodities due to unavailability or poor quality of actual consumption data to determine the true commodity need, delays in approving the supply plan to commence procurement, poorly implemented annual supply plans and irregular last mile distribution mostly due to lack of funding, limits the provision of quality LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nFear of side effects—real or perceived—is another key barrier hindering the use of LARCs. For example, some women fear that some methods cause excessive bleeding and infertility (Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; The RESPOND Project, 2013; Udigwe et al., 2002). There were common beliefs that if a woman does not give birth to all the children in her womb, she may develop cancer (The RESPOND Project, 2013; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Another commonly held opinion is that a couple should not use any family planning methods early in their childbearing years, to avoid infertility. Some men fear that women become promiscuous when they practice family planning (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nLack of support from the husband not only hinders initial contraceptive use but may also lead to pre- mature termination of use of a long-acting method (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ikechebelu et al., 2005; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; The RESPOND Project, 2013). To resolve this and achieve their birth-limiting goals, some women use contraceptive methods covertly, although such behavior may result in serious marital disharmony if the husband learns of it (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nOther barriers to the use of LARCs include cultural bias (certain cultures are highly supportive of large family size), myths and misconceptions about LARCs, gender inequity, religious beliefs, fear of infection and reduction/loss of libido (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; The RESPOND Project, 2013; Ugboaja et al., 2011; Ukaegbu, 1977)."

    "section": "3.7 Discontinuation",
    "text": "3.7 Discontinuation\nThe discontinuation rate varied considerably across the different LARCs types and with the duration of usage. Unsurprisingly, there was an increase in discontinuation rates over time, particularly for injectables which typically require two-monthly or three-monthly administration. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation at 12 months of use was highest among women using DMPA injectables, ranging from 50 percent to 62 percent (Chigbu et al., 2010; Fakeye, 1991; Hu et al., 2012; Ogedengbe et al., 1987). However, in Osogbo a slightly lower rate of 22.4 percent was observed (Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012). Interestingly, an Enugu study documented a low discontinuation rate (12.8 percent) even at 36 months (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Falase et al., 1989; Ojule et al., 2010). Compared to injectables, implants and IUDs had better continuity owing to their longer life span. The 12-month discontinuation rate for IUDs was 10%-22% (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Fakeye, 1991; Okunlola et al., 2006; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; van Dierendonck et al., 1992), while those for implants were 1-8 percent for Implanon® (Ezegwui et al., 2011; Mutihir & Duru, 2008)and 5.4-9.8% for Norplant® (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Fakeye, 1991). Jadelle®, a relatively new contraceptive implant in Nigeria, had no discontinuations among users in Rivers State (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011). Ogedengbe et al. (Ogedengbe et al., 1987), however, observed comparable discontinuation rates between IUDs (45.6%) and Injectables (50.2%). For Norplant®, after 36 months, approximately 11-18% of users had discontinued use (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Ozumba et al., 1998).\nSimilar to other contraceptives, LARCs are not without side effects. Side effects/health concerns were the primary reason for discontinuing LARCs. Common side effects like changes in menstrual cycle, irregular spotting of blood through the vagina and amenorrhea have been associated to the use of progestogen-only methods (Okafor, 2018).  To reduce the occurrence of side-effects and promote use, LARCs should be selected based on informed decisions. This is an important principle in the delivery of LARCs (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Women using LARCs should also be counseled, so they can cope easily with side effects, to avoid dissatisfactions and unnecessary discontinuations of the methods (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nThe most frequently reported reasons for discontinuing LARCs were the desire for pregnancy (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2010; Mutihir & Nyango, 2010; Ogedengbe et al., 1987; Okunlola et al., 2006; Sagay et al., 2008; van Dierendonck et al., 1992) and menstrual side effects (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Chigbu et al., 2010; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir & Nyango, 2010; Obi & Anya, 2000; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; Ozumba et al., 1998). Abnormal menstruation, particularly amenorrhea, was a commonly cited reason by users of contraceptive injectable (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Chigbu et al., 2010; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012). Spousal factors such as husband’s objection and husband’s deaths were also linked with discontinuation (F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005). Expulsion of contraceptive devices was also reported among IUD users (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Fakeye, 1991; Mutihir et al., 2006; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Ogedengbe et al., 1987)."

    "section": "3.8 Policies",
    "text": "3.8 Policies\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGON) have made considerably good strides in creating an enabling environment for LARCs to thrive (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). For instance, certain positive policy reforms have occurred, notably the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy which allows CHEWs to administer Injectables (they are still restricted from providing IUDs and implants) (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014, 2020). Additional reforms include making LARCs free in public-sector clinics and reforming the nurse/midwife training curriculum to make it proficiency-based and supported by rigorous supervision (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Shelton & Finkle, 2016). These policy reforms yielded some success in the uptake of LARCs. For instance, between 2008 and 2013, the use of Implants increased from 0.4 to 3.4 percent (National Population Commission and ICF International, 2009, 2014). Nigeria’s Family Planning Effort (FPE) ratings in 2014 also indicate notable progress in Policies and Access (Avenir Health, 2016). Nevertheless, the country’s FPE scores, are still very low compared to other countries in the region (Avenir Health, 2016). Hence, intensive efforts are needed to significantly improve Nigeria’s FP policy and program environment (Avenir Health, 2016).\nCurrently, there are at least four plans with Family Planning/Reproductive Health goals associated with them. These are the National LARC Strategy, the Reproductive Health Commodity Strategy, the National Strategic Health Development Plan, and the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) Strategy (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Other important policies include the National Youth Policy (2009); Gender Policy (2008); National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria (2007) and the National School Health Policy (2006). The latter provides the framework for implementing the national school health program (Cortez et al., 2015).\nAdditionally, the FGON committed to further creating an enabling environment for family planning activities (including LARCs). This commitment was buttressed in the following actions: revitalizing its commitment in the 2017 Summit on Family Planning, developing a national guideline to scale-up private providers’ access to government’s free FP commodities, reviewing the National Reproductive Health Policy and The Reproductive Health Strategic Framework and developing an accelerated introduction and scale-up plan for the Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to increase access to injectable contraceptives (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nHowever, there are still some gaps in some of the policies, especially pertaining access to family planning services and rights to adolescents and youths (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nCurrently, reproductive health policies do not indicate unrestricted access to Family planning (including LARCs) services for youths, without provider discretion, parental or spousal consent (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\n. Most policies and national documents are vague on the age of consent for youths (i.e. age of consent) (Power et al., 2021). These documents do not explicitly state the youth’s legal right to freely and independently access a full range of contraceptive services, including LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Hence, health providers choosing to provide service to adolescents and youth are not protected by any policy statement that legally authorizes health providers to offer contraceptive services to this age group (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nFurthermore, the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy does not adequately recognize the large resource pool of providers within the healthcare system that can offer some LARC services (e.g., injectables) These healthcare providers include; the Junior Community Health Extension Worker (JCHEWs), Community Pharmacists, Community Midwives and PPMVs. Inclusion of these providers in the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy is vital as these cadre could play important roles in providing LARCs to women since in a large proportion of rural facilities, they may be the only available healthcare providers (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nAnother policy challenge is the poor translation of existing policies to action (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). There is a recurrent challenge of timely and effective implementation of most policies/guidelines (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). This is especially so because the autonomy of adoption and implementation of policies made by the Federal Ministry of Health falls on the State Ministry of Health. For example, since the approval of the Task Shifting Policy in 2012, as at 2019, 13 states are yet to begin domestication (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Likewise, for the National FP Blueprint, 14 states are yet to domesticate the plan to state level costed implementation plans since its launch in 2014 (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\n\nTable 1: Summary of policy challenges |——–|——–|——–|——————————————-|——–| | | | | | | | | S/N | | Policy Challenges | | | | | | | | | | 1. | | Inadequate policies supporting Adolescent and Youth Family Planning | | | | | | | | | | 2. | | Ambiguities in existing Family Planning policies (especially around adolescent and youth | | | | | | | | | | 3. | | Poor translation of existing policies to action | | | | | | | |\nSource: Nigeria Family Planning Blue Print (2020-2024), 2020."

    "text": "3.9 Programs and Initiatives\nSeveral programs and initiatives have been launched to support the government’s efforts to increase uptake of LARCs and utmostly achieve the national family planning goals of a modern contraceptive prevalence of 27 percent (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). These programs have strikingly increased the provision of LARCs in Nigeria (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). The most recent includes:\n·        The Marie Stopes Nigeria “BlueStar” social franchising program (2012): This supports more than 300 private-sector providers, particularly in the South, of whom about 70% are midwives. The midwives in turn provided a notably large number of women—more than 65,000—with contraception, especially implants, in 2015.\n·        The Society for Family Health’s “Healthy Family Network social franchising program, with more than 300 service providers, has likewise been successful, although more with the IUDs.\n·        DKT International also launched a program that gives support to private providers, particularly in the South. Its model consists primarily of marketing contraceptive products to providers and distributors, without the networking and other components of social franchising. LARC sales in 2015 was at more than 100,000 which is striking.\n·        Marie Stopes Nigeria commenced a program focused on deploying “mobile outreach” teams in the North. These mobile outreaches typically occur in collaboration with the public sector and in public-sector sites. Remarkably, with only 8 outreach teams, they provided about 63,000 clients with LARCs in 2015, primarily implants\n·        Marie Stopes Nigeria also began the Family Health Plus initiative in 2014. It works with public-sector providers at the state level, now expanded to 20 states, emphasizing training, supportive supervision, and supply chain. Again, providing LARCs to more than 250,000 clients in 2015.\nMore than 550,000 women have received LARCs from just these 5 initiatives, representing over 2% of married women of reproductive age and 1.5% of all women of reproductive age in Nigeria (Shelton & Finkle, 2016).\nLARCs engender high rates of satisfaction and continuation, the sustained cumulative effect of these programs over a period of time would be substantial.  For instance, between 2014 and 2015, the share of overall modern contraceptive use for implants in Kaduna state (where Family Health Plus, Healthy Family Network, Marie Stopes Nigeria mobile outreach, and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative as well as others) are all active, increased from 16 percent to 28 percent (Nigeria - Kaduna and Lagos Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Survey, Round 2 2015 | GHDx, n.d.).\nFurthermore, these programs have provided proof for many vague concepts about LARC uptake in Nigeria. First, it can now be firmly stated that LARCs are highly acceptable for Nigerian women desiring contraception (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Second, promoting equity by providing LARC services in very low-income as well as higher-income clients is highly efficient (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). A precedent, indicates that 75 percent, 53 percent, and 49 percent of Marie Stopes Nigeria’s mobile outreach, Family Health Plus, and social franchising clients, respectively, were from households living on less than US$2.50 per day (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Third, success is attainable in every geographical zone in Nigeria. While it is generally held that the more conservative North is highly resistant to family planning, these projects—notably, mobile outreach and the Family Health Plus public-sector support project demonstrate that with concerted efforts, success can be achieved in the North as well (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Fourth, the Family Health Plus program showed that despite the public sector’s reputation as a weak service delivery platform, when the private sector works closely with the government, public-sector service delivery on LARCs can be successful (Shelton & Finkle, 2016).\nTable 2: Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods by Selected Program Initiatives, Nigeria, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\nImplants\nIUDs\nTotal LARCs\n\n\nBlue Star (Marie Stopes Nigeria\n51,643\n13,811\n65,454\n\n\nHealthy Family Network (SFH)\n20,273\n53,900\n74,173\n\n\nDKT International Sales\n15,967\n87,600\n103,567\n\n\nMobile Outreaches (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n53,786\n9,200\n62,986\n\n\nFamily Health Plus (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n222,705\n29,686\n252,391\n\n\nTotal\n364,374\n194,197\n558,571\n\n\n\nSource: For Marie Stopes Nigeria - personal communication with Anna Mackay; Deputy Director of SIFPO Project for Marie Stopes International; for SFH - personal communication with Peter Entonu, (Associate Director of Social Franchise Unit); for DKT, sales report from December 2015.\nIn addition to the programs described above, a number of other worthwhile initiatives are ongoing in Nigeria, including traditional social marketing and clinic-based public-sector and NGO service (Shelton & Finkle, 2016)."

    "section": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:",
    "text": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:\nThe Knowledge of long-acting reversible contraception was relatively low in comparison with other Sub-Saharan African countries; nevertheless, there have been remarkable improvement. (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019). For instance, in 2003, only 27 percent of Nigerian women had heard of IUDs, 57 percent of Injectables and 10 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004) . Nonetheless, by 2018, 46 percent of women had heard of IUDs, 82 percent of Injectables and 70 percent of Implants (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019).\nAwareness of LARCs varied with geographical location, wealth quintile and education levels. Women living in rural, and less literate North East and North West zones were least likely to be informed on any method of long-acting contraception (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019).  In contrast, women residing in urban Southern regions, (especially South West) were well-educated on the different LARCs available to them . Expectedly, low levels of education and household income led to reduced knowledge and awareness of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009; National Population Commission and ICF International 2014, 2019).\nWomen obtained information on LARCs from various sources. Primarily, such information were from friends and family (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Ameh and Sule 2007; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Secondary sources include: radio/television/newspapers/magazines, school lectures/workshops/seminars and health workers (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Monjok et al. 2010; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olukoya 1991; Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005). This is interesting because first, it indicates the importance of ensuring that non-medical personnel have access to the right information on LARCs since most women are more likely to get their foremost information from informal sources (Olukoya 1991). Second, it also suggests that organizing community-directed outreaches centered on raising awareness and providing information on LARCs to community members may yield notable results since women are more inclined to learn about LARCs primarily from their immediate community (Olukoya 1991).\nIn a slightly different pattern, female students sourced their information on LARCs primarily from social media, lectures, seminars, friends, family and secondarily, from health workers (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). This may probably be due to the academic environment (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). The positive effect of this observation lies in the potential of increased awareness through seminar, workshops and social media adverts (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Copper T, Depo Provera®, Noristerat® and Implanon® were the most popular brands of LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012) among female students. Female students who had previous induced abortion were significantly more knowledgable about LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012).  Their experience of an induced abortion may have triggered the quest to obtain information on more effective and reliable ways of preventing unplanned pregnancies (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Parents often feel uncomfortable communicating issues bothering sex or in some cases, lack adequate information on LARCs. As a result, young females are more reluctant to get information on LARCs from them (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005).\nDifferent studies had contrasting views on the influence of religion on the knowledge of LARCs. Some studies reported the effect of religious beliefs on the knowledge, awareness and subsequent use of LARCs. For instance, Christian women were reportedly more aware of LARCs than women belonging to other religions in Nigeria (Ayangade, 1984; Egede et al., 2015; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Olaleye et al., 2014; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011). However, this maybe not be a true reflection nationally, as due cognizance must be taken of a possible confounding of Christianity being the predominant religion in the regions of some of these studies (Adeyemi et al., 2008; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; Ugboaja et al., 2011).  In contrast, two studies conducted by Aduloju et al  in 2021, and Orji and Odimegwu in 2002 (2021; 2002) stated that religion, did not have any statistical significance (P &gt; 0.05) on the knowledge and awareness of LARCs.\nThe gap between the Knowledge of LARCs and its actual usage was widen (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; Olusegun et al., 2012; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002). The implication of this is that awareness alone does not determine the utilization of LARCs by Nigerian women (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; Olusegun et al., 2012; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002). The common reasons for this gap include: lack of knowledge on provider centers, distance from the source of LARCs, adequate information on the benefits of LARCs, fear of possible side effects, fear of the procedure, husband disapproval, religion and culture (Aduloju et al., 2021; Olusegun et al., 2012; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001) Figure 2: Knowledge of LARC methods   \nSource: NDHS 2003, NDHS 2008, NDHS 2013 & NDHS 2018\nThe acceptance and use of LARCs was largely dependent on the attitude of women (Aduloju et al., 2021). Women’s attitude (positive or negative) towards LARCs was primarily determined by their level of education and number of surviving children (especially sons). Improvement in health, maintenance of a smaller family size and the fact that it made life more comfortable steered a positive attitude in women which made them four times more likely to use LARCs (Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015). Some women frowned at LARCs because they viewed regulating their fertility as an unhealthy immoral behavior which is an affront to the God-given blessing of fertility (Renne, 1997; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ukaegbu, 1977)\nAnother contributing factor to the attitude of the women to LARCs was the viewpoint of health workers. For instance, although family planning and health workers may promote the use of LARCs like IUDs, some do so with reservations, advising women not to use IUDs if they have not had children before (Renne, 1997)."

    "section": "3.3 Access to LARCs",
    "text": "3.3 Access to LARCs\nNigerian women seek long-acting reversible contraception from both public and private sectors (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Government hospitals, government health centers and family planning clinics were major public health outlets for LARCs  (Egede et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). While family/private hospital/clinics and private pharmacies, popularly called “chemist shops” were popular private sector outlets (Ayangade, 1984; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARCs such as IUDs, Implants, and Injectables were primarily sourced from the public sector because they require trained service delivery (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nThe ease of accessing LARCs, proximity of service providers and level of confidentiality offered by service providers were key considerations in choosing where to get LARCs, given that some women used LARCs without their husband’s knowledge or approval (Egede et al., 2015)(Onwujekwe et al., 2013). Patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops being the most proximate and accessible providers were the major sources of LARCs that do not require trained medical services.\nReligion and denomination also influenced the source of purchase. Reported that while Roman Catholics purchase LARCs chiefly from patent medicine shops, the majority of other Christians procure theirs from general hospitals (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). The patronage of patent medicine shops by Catholics maybe associated with a religious objection to the use of modern contraceptive methods and the desire to keep their purchase of LARCs “confidential.” Similarly, Muslims patronized patent medicine shops more frequently, also due to reported high disapproval by of contraceptives (Egede et al., 2015; Onwujekwe et al., 2013; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005).\nFigure 3: Source of LARCs (Public Sector)\nSource: NDHS 2018\nFigure 4: Source of LARCs (Private Sector)                                                                                                          \nSource: NDHS, 2018\nThere were geographical differences in accessing LARCs. Urban dwellers procured LARCs from government hospitals, private clinics, and pharmacy shops with qualified pharmacists (Onwujekwe et al., 2013). In contrast, rural dwellers got theirs mostly from patent medicine dealers (Onwujekwe et al., 2013), probably due to the proximity of these patent medicine shops and high cost transportation from rural to urban regions where bigger health facilities are located. This trend of the patent medicine shops being the most popular source of LARCs in rural regions is worrisome, since most of the patent medicine dealers are untrained (Monjok et al., 2010) .\nMost women held the opinion that LARCs were not easily accessible (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). However, the proportion of women who thought that LARCs were not readily accessible decreased consistently with increase in educational status and residence in urban areas (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). Hence, one can infer that with exposure to education, women become well informed on the various means of accessing LARCs and are financially capable of purchasing them.\nAlthough a good number of Nigerian women desire them (The RESPOND Project, 2013), there are certain barriers to accessing the wide variety of LARCs available. First, is the reduced availability of LARCs in certain family planning clinics (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The RESPOND project, reported feedback by one of the service providers where she buttressed this challenge:\n“..Sometimes we run out of stock but not too frequently; when that happens, I will go into the market to get some so that we will have the methods, because we are mindful of our clients’ appointment dates…. I used to tell the community that the IUD is now costly because we used to get it from black market in Makurdi…” (The RESPOND Project, 2013)\n —Service provider, Adikpo, Benue State, Nigeria\nThe lack of basic supplies and equipment most often lead providers to charge unauthorized fees that some women cannot afford or request clients to purchase LARC supplies from the black market notorious for its uncertain quality (The RESPOND Project, 2013). Second, some family planning clinics are in a poor state of repair, and many had either no or only intermittent electricity all of which discourages women (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nThe third barrier to accessing LARCs is the shortage of skilled providers to deliver LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). For instance, although the policy that permits Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to deliver Injectables was approved in 2012, only few CHEWs have received formal training on how to deliver the method properly (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Regarding other LARCs, Implants were introduced on a larger scale in the public sector only in 2006, and it is plausible that many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public system (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Many experienced Family Planning (FP) providers cited the lack of continuing education and training as the reason for the rather reduced skill set in administering LARCs, pointing to the 1980s as the last time that large-scale FP training efforts were in place (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014)."

    "section": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence",
    "text": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence\nThe contraceptive prevalence (CPR) of LARCs remain low relative to other short-acting contraceptives. Nevertheless, the CPR of LARCs increased steadily from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 7.4 percent in 2018 among married women using contraceptives (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Nationally, about 14.8 percent of women currently using any method of contraception used LARCs (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020). The prevalence LARCs was highest among women aged 35 years and above and lowest among those aged 15-24 (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Injectables and IUDs were the most frequently used LARC (Adegbola & Okunowo, 2009; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Okunlola et al., 2006, 2009; Onwuhafua et al., 2005; Ozumba & Ibekwe, 2001; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011)\n\nUse of LARCs varied with residence, region, level of education, number of living children, and economic status of the household (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Married women residing in urban areas were more likely to use LARCs than their rural counterparts (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Onwuhafua et al., 2005). The limited use of LARCs in rural areas persists for various reasons ranging from unavailability of the LARC methods to lack of proﬁciency in administering LARCs by rural care providers (Onwuhafua et al., 2005). The South-West zone had the highest proportion of women using LARCs, followed by the South-South zone (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The lowest proportion of married women using any LARC method were in the North-East (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARC use increased with educational attainment across all geopolitical zones (Adeyemi et al., 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). By wealth quintile, women in the lowest quintile were least likely to use long-acting reversible contraception and women in the highest quintile were most likely to use them (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nUse of LARCs was relatively low among singles compared to married women (Ijarotimi et al., 2015; Olaleye et al., 2014; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). This may be because single women are less likely to source for contraception openly because of cultural and religious prohibition of premarital sex in Nigeria (Ijarotimi et al., 2015).\n\n\nThe uptake of LARCs increased with parity; women do not begin to use LARCs until they have had at least one child (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; Konje et al., 1998; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Udigwe et al., 2002).\nAn attribute pointing to the reproductive need of women with less than 3 children and the popular consideration of LARC methods as an alternative to the sterilization method (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ijarotimi et al., 2015).\nThe most common reasons for using any method of long-acting reversible contraception were safety, reversibility, effectiveness, long-term protection, convenience, husband’s approval, understanding of the LARC method, personal choice, the desire to have good maternal health, satisfaction with information given on insertion procedure and services rendered by the healthcare provider recommendation by another woman who had used the method, affordability, approval by religion and duration of the desired LARC (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015; Ojo et al., 2020; ‘Views on Family Planning and Long-Acting and Permanent Methods’, 2013).\nLack of knowledge, not being married, fear of the procedure, dislike of foreign body, inability to access LARCs, husband’s objection, fear of side effects/complications, fear of infertility, need for further counselling, high cost of LARCs, preference for natural methods, lack of knowledge on provider centers, inadequate information on the benefits of LARCs, conﬂicts with their religious and cultural beliefs were the major reasons given by the women for not using LARCs (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Egede et al., 2015; Eke & Alabi-Isama, 2011; Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Ikechebelu et al., 2005; Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; Konje et al., 1998; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Ojo et al., 2020; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; Onwuhafua et al., 2005; Orji & Onwudiegwu, 2002; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011; Ukaegbu, 1977). In their study, Eke & Alabi-Isama (2011) reported that most adolescent females thought that LARCs should not be used by unmarried women. \nMost women thought that negotiating and deciding with their husbands prior the use of any LARC method was necessary (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; The RESPOND Project, 2013). But in reality, men alone played the dominant role in women’s decision to adopt long-acting reversible contraception and in the choice of method (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Omu & Unuigbe, 1986; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The dominant role of men affected the use of LARCs because men generally demonstrated less favorable attitudes toward family planning than women and were less knowledgeable about LARCs (The RESPOND Project, 2013). Hence, a woman’s ability to control her fertility and her choice of long-acting reversible contraception were partly determined by her empowerment status and self-image (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). A woman who is unable to control her life may be less likely to feel she can make and carry out decisions about her fertility (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nDepo Provera® and Noristerat® were the most commonly used brands of Injectables (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Depo Provera® was largely used by women in the South-East and North-West zones, while Noristerat® was primarily used by women in the North-East (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Notably, Depo Provera was the brand of choice for women in the lowest, second and fourth wealth quintile, who had either secondary, primary or no education (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014). Conversely, the use of Noristerat® increased with educational attainment and wealth status (National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014).\nOvertime, the use of Implants, particularly Implanon® and Jadelle® became popular (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Tunau et al., 2019). It even seems that Implants have slowly replaced IUDs which were commonly used earlier (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Tunau et al., 2019). Highly educated women preferred Implants and had higher odds of using them the less educated counterparts. The plausible motive for this preference maybe the increased capacity to manage information correctly by educated women and awareness of the associated advantages of using Implants education provides (Ojo et al., 2020). Non-literate women appeared to be suspicious of new methods and therefore shunned the method (Mutihir & Duru, 2008). Specifically, young Nigerian women with desire for future fertility formed significant proportion of Implanon® acceptors (Roberts et al., 2015).\nIUDs are quite common and widely used in Nigeria, particularly by older married women aged 35 and above (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005) but are gradually losing their appeal. They were least commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Religious constraints seem to be the major propeller behind this; Muslim women while not considering family planning as un-Islamic, often view the insertion of an external object into their body to be sacrilegious (Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984).  Although still used in other regions in Nigeria, IUDs are gradually losing favor in the South-Western region (Ameh & Sule, 2007; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The need for their husband’s consent maybe one of the primary reasons for the general decline in the application of IUDs. The thread from the IUDs often give women away when using them without their husband’s consent (F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005). The most common reason for discontinuation was a desire for pregnancy, especially among those younger than 35 years (Oye-Adeniran et al., 2005). Married women were more likely to use IUDs than singles, as most singles opt for other forms of contraception (E. C. Ezugwu et al., 2020).\nNigerian women are most often not aware or have misconceptions on the benefits and side effects of long-acting reversible contraception (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). Hence, the need to heighten awareness, to enable women make informed decisions while choosing a LARC method. Women who used injectables and IUDs were more informed on the side effects of these methods, what to do if they experienced side effects and other methods of long-acting contraception available to them than women who opted for Implants (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). LARC users were least likely to receive information about side effects or safety issues from a private medical facility than from a government hospital (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). The same was true of information on what to do if they experienced side effects. (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nAlthough some women were not current users, they indicated interest in using Injectables and IUDs in the future (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; The RESPOND Project, 2013). The proportion of Nigerian women who were non-users, but intend to use a modern method of contraception (such as LARCs) in the future was lowest in the North-East. This was the same for uneducated women living in rural areas (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013).  Knowledge of this is crucial in order to meet the rising demand for LARCs by Nigerian women. These statistics confirm that demand generation will be a critical component of meeting the national contraceptive prevalence goal (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Concerning the household wealth-index, women from poor households (lowest and second wealth quintiles) subscribed less to the different LARC methods compared to women from middle and wealthy households (middle, fourth and highest wealth quintiles) (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Women aged 25 years and above were more likely to use a LARC method compared to women aged 15–24 years (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Udigwe et al., 2002; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Additionally, women who had 1–4 children subscribed further to LARC methods as opposed to women with no children (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020) (Bolarinwa & Olagunju, 2020; Ijarotimi et al., 2015; National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004; Ugboaja et al., 2011)."

    "title": "\nUse of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives in Nigeria: A Scoping Review",
    "section": "3.6 Effectiveness",
    "text": "3.6 Effectiveness\nGenerally, LARCs were found to be a highly effective method of birth control, with several studies reporting no accidental pregnancies (Pearl index= 0) (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Aisien, 2007; Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Balogun et al., 2014; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Farr et al., 1996; Ladipo et al., 1993; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; Roberts et al., 2015). While there were a few reports of unintended pregnancies, the failure rate was very minimal, ranging from 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Chigbu et al., 2010; Enyindah et al., 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2010; Obi & Anya, 2000; Ojule et al., 2010). Although a relatively high failure rate of 3.7 percent was reported among IUD users in Abia State (Chigbu et al., 2010), unexpected pregnancy was observed in just one out of the 27 IUD users. Larger studies, however, revealed that IUDs, particularly Copper T-380A, were effective in over 99 percent of users (Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Farr et al., 1996; Obi & Anya, 2000). Similar high rates were found among users of progesterone-only injectables, notably Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Chigbu et al., 2010; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012) and Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), and contraceptive subdermal implants, such as Implanon® (Balogun et al., 2014; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Roberts et al., 2015) Jadelle® (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011)  and Norplant® (Aisien, 2007; Ladipo et al., 1993; Mutihir et al., 2010). A study in Jos reported one failure (3.3 percent) among 30 women who requested for and had Implanon® rods removed (Mutihir & Nyango, 2010). However, this failure was due to inadvertent insertion of the implant during pregnancy.\n3.6 Safety Profile and Complications\nWhile LARCs were generally reported to be safe, the chief complaints were menstrual abnormalities (Adaji et al., 2005; Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014; Chigbu et al., 2010; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah & Kasso, 2011; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Falase et al., 1989; Farr et al., 1996; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2006; Obi & Anya, 2000; Ojule et al., 2010; Okunlola et al., 2009; Roberts et al., 2015). Secondary amenorrhea was the most prevalent menstrual disturbance among women using progesterone-only injectables (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah et al., 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Okunlola et al., 2006; Sagay et al., 2008) and reported to a lesser extent by users of IUDs (Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Okunlola et al., 2009) and subdermal implants (Balogun et al., 2014; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Roberts et al., 2015). One study in Enugu, however, reported amenorrhea as the main side effect experienced by Jadelle® users (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011). Other menstrual disturbances associated with the use of LARCs include irregular bleeding, heavy/prolonged bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Also frequently reported complaints were lower abdominal pain (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Aisien, 2007; Chigbu et al., 2010; Enyindah et al., 2012; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012; Okunlola et al., 2009) and vaginal discharge. Breast pain was also reported with the use of implants (Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014). There were also considerable cases of weight gain (Abasiattai et al., 2010; Chigbu et al., 2010; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012) and a far lesser proportion of weight loss (Chigbu et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2012) among women using contraceptive injectables. Interestingly, there were a few reports of weight gain in users of IUDs and Implant, with one study in Jos reporting an average weight gain of 2.6kg among users of Copper T-380A (Mutihir et al., 2006). Meanwhile, Sagay et al. suggested that Norplant tends to prolong PR and QRS electrocardiogram intervals (Sagay et al., 2008). Similarly, hypertension was associated with the use of injectables (Akadri & Odelola, 2017; Hu et al., 2012; Ojule et al., 2010), though report. Expulsion and missing IUDs were also reported in a few studies(Abasiattai, A. M. et al., 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Obi & Anya, 2000; Okunlola et al., 2009).\n3.7 Barriers to use of LARCs\nShortage of skilled providers to deliver available LARC services is a major barrier to the uptake of LARCs. As stated earlier, only few approved CHEWs have actually received formal training on delivering injectables (i.e., providing the necessary counselling, screening for pregnancy, and delivering the actual injection) [29]. In the North, women rely on CHEWs with at least two years of post-secondary school education as the primary point of care (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). In addition to their primary responsibility in delivering LARCs, these CHEWs often function as the sole staff members of Primary Health Care Centers, providing all the care in the community and sometimes delivering services for which they are not properly trained (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). As at October 2018, 65 percent of Nigerian health facilities have a LARC-trained service provider (Bietsch et al., 2020). But only 36 percent of these facilities provided LARCs to women at the same period. This shortage maybe because many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public sector or that commodities, tool and job aids for delivering services are unavailable (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nSome studies indicated that many service providers contributed to barriers to uptake by restricting access, based on their personal cultural/social norms or client’s personal characteristics (i.e. age, parity, and marital status) (Camara et al., 2017; Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). A 2017 study which reviewed restrictions to contraceptive access imposed by service providers (nurses/midwives, patent and proprietary medicine vendors, CHEWs and pharmacists), showed that service preferences were given to clients who were married or older than 24yrs (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). Similarly, the performance monitoring for action (PMA) 2020’s Adolescents and Young Adults Health Brief indicated that unmarried individuals might be able to services for male condoms and emergency contraceptives – but are less likely to access same for LARCs (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). As a result, unmarried individuals might choose not to use LARCs or opt for methods that are more likely accessible but less effective (International Planned Parenthood Federation, 2020). The unavailability of adequate youth-friendly Family Planning service points may be the biggest factor in preventing adolescents from accessing LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nAnother salient barrier to the uptake of LARCs which has most often been over-looked is the poor integration of family planning services (including LARCs) with maternal and new-born health, childhood immunization, nutrition programmes and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Although during pregnancy, women may not actively seek FP information or services, but they often engage proactively with the healthcare system during antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and ﬁrst year infant immunizations (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). These contact points offer valuable and reliable opportunities for healthcare providers to educate the women on LARC services. Some of the challenges of integration of FP with Maternal and Newborn & Child Health (MNCH) include resistance within the separate health programme responsible for FP and Maternal and Child Health services, facility or community-based workers who are not trained or have inadequate staff time to address both MNCH and FP needs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nIncreased stock-outs of commodities due to unavailability or poor quality of actual consumption data to determine the true commodity need, delays in approving the supply plan to commence procurement, poorly implemented annual supply plans and irregular last mile distribution mostly due to lack of funding, limits the provision of quality LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nFear of side effects—real or perceived—is another key barrier hindering the use of LARCs. For example, some women fear that some methods cause excessive bleeding and infertility (Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; The RESPOND Project, 2013; Udigwe et al., 2002). There were common beliefs that if a woman does not give birth to all the children in her womb, she may develop cancer (The RESPOND Project, 2013; Ugboaja et al., 2011). Another commonly held opinion is that a couple should not use any family planning methods early in their childbearing years, to avoid infertility. Some men fear that women become promiscuous when they practice family planning (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nLack of support from the husband not only hinders initial contraceptive use but may also lead to pre- mature termination of use of a long-acting method (Aduloju et al., 2021; Ikechebelu et al., 2005; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; The RESPOND Project, 2013). To resolve this and achieve their birth-limiting goals, some women use contraceptive methods covertly, although such behavior may result in serious marital disharmony if the husband learns of it (The RESPOND Project, 2013).\nOther barriers to the use of LARCs include cultural bias (certain cultures are highly supportive of large family size), myths and misconceptions about LARCs, gender inequity, religious beliefs, fear of infection and reduction/loss of libido (Adinma et al., 1998; Aduloju et al., 2021; Inyang-Etoh & Abah, 2017; Onwuzurike & Uzochukwu, 2001; The RESPOND Project, 2013; Ugboaja et al., 2011; Ukaegbu, 1977)."

    "section": "3.7 Discontinuation",
    "text": "3.7 Discontinuation\nThe discontinuation rate varied considerably across the different LARCs types and with the duration of usage. Unsurprisingly, there was an increase in discontinuation rates over time, particularly for injectables which typically require two-monthly or three-monthly administration. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation at 12 months of use was highest among women using DMPA injectables, ranging from 50 percent to 62 percent (Chigbu et al., 2010; Fakeye, 1991; Hu et al., 2012; Ogedengbe et al., 1987). However, in Osogbo a slightly lower rate of 22.4 percent was observed (Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012). Interestingly, an Enugu study documented a low discontinuation rate (12.8 percent) even at 36 months (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005; Falase et al., 1989; Ojule et al., 2010). Compared to injectables, implants and IUDs had better continuity owing to their longer life span. The 12-month discontinuation rate for IUDs was 10%-22% (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Fakeye, 1991; Okunlola et al., 2006; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; van Dierendonck et al., 1992), while those for implants were 1-8 percent for Implanon® (Ezegwui et al., 2011; Mutihir & Duru, 2008)and 5.4-9.8% for Norplant® (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Fakeye, 1991). Jadelle®, a relatively new contraceptive implant in Nigeria, had no discontinuations among users in Rivers State (Enyindah & Kasso, 2011). Ogedengbe et al. (Ogedengbe et al., 1987), however, observed comparable discontinuation rates between IUDs (45.6%) and Injectables (50.2%). For Norplant®, after 36 months, approximately 11-18% of users had discontinued use (Aisien, 2007; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Ozumba et al., 1998).\nSimilar to other contraceptives, LARCs are not without side effects. Side effects/health concerns were the primary reason for discontinuing LARCs. Common side effects like changes in menstrual cycle, irregular spotting of blood through the vagina and amenorrhea have been associated to the use of progestogen-only methods (Okafor, 2018).  To reduce the occurrence of side-effects and promote use, LARCs should be selected based on informed decisions. This is an important principle in the delivery of LARCs (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004). Women using LARCs should also be counseled, so they can cope easily with side effects, to avoid dissatisfactions and unnecessary discontinuations of the methods (National Population Commission & ICF International, 2019; National Population Commission & International, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission & Macro, 2004).\nThe most frequently reported reasons for discontinuing LARCs were the desire for pregnancy (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Aisien, 2007; Balogun et al., 2014; Ekabua & Itam, 2007; Enyindah et al., 2012; Mutihir et al., 2010; Mutihir & Nyango, 2010; Ogedengbe et al., 1987; Okunlola et al., 2006; Sagay et al., 2008; van Dierendonck et al., 1992) and menstrual side effects (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Chigbu et al., 2010; Ezegwui et al., 2011; Fakeye, 1991; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012; Mutihir & Nyango, 2010; Obi & Anya, 2000; Oyediran & Akinla, 1980; Ozumba et al., 1998). Abnormal menstruation, particularly amenorrhea, was a commonly cited reason by users of contraceptive injectable (Adaji et al., 2005; Adeyemi & Adekanle, 2012; Chigbu et al., 2010; Falase et al., 1989; Hu et al., 2012). Spousal factors such as husband’s objection and husband’s deaths were also linked with discontinuation (F. O. Ezugwu & Anya, 2005). Expulsion of contraceptive devices was also reported among IUD users (Adegbola & Ogedengbe, 2008; Enyindah et al., 2012; Fakeye, 1991; Mutihir et al., 2006; Naghma-E-Rehan et al., 1984; Ogedengbe et al., 1987)."

    "text": "3.8 Policies\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGON) have made considerably good strides in creating an enabling environment for LARCs to thrive (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013). For instance, certain positive policy reforms have occurred, notably the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy which allows CHEWs to administer Injectables (they are still restricted from providing IUDs and implants) (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014, 2020). Additional reforms include making LARCs free in public-sector clinics and reforming the nurse/midwife training curriculum to make it proficiency-based and supported by rigorous supervision (Federal Ministry of Health, 2013; Shelton & Finkle, 2016). These policy reforms yielded some success in the uptake of LARCs. For instance, between 2008 and 2013, the use of Implants increased from 0.4 to 3.4 percent (National Population Commission and ICF International, 2009, 2014). Nigeria’s Family Planning Effort (FPE) ratings in 2014 also indicate notable progress in Policies and Access (Avenir Health, 2016). Nevertheless, the country’s FPE scores, are still very low compared to other countries in the region (Avenir Health, 2016). Hence, intensive efforts are needed to significantly improve Nigeria’s FP policy and program environment (Avenir Health, 2016).\nCurrently, there are at least four plans with Family Planning/Reproductive Health goals associated with them. These are the National LARC Strategy, the Reproductive Health Commodity Strategy, the National Strategic Health Development Plan, and the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) Strategy (Federal Ministry of Health, 2014). Other important policies include the National Youth Policy (2009); Gender Policy (2008); National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria (2007) and the National School Health Policy (2006). The latter provides the framework for implementing the national school health program (Cortez et al., 2015).\nAdditionally, the FGON committed to further creating an enabling environment for family planning activities (including LARCs). This commitment was buttressed in the following actions: revitalizing its commitment in the 2017 Summit on Family Planning, developing a national guideline to scale-up private providers’ access to government’s free FP commodities, reviewing the National Reproductive Health Policy and The Reproductive Health Strategic Framework and developing an accelerated introduction and scale-up plan for the Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to increase access to injectable contraceptives (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nHowever, there are still some gaps in some of the policies, especially pertaining access to family planning services and rights to adolescents and youths (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nCurrently, reproductive health policies do not indicate unrestricted access to Family planning (including LARCs) services for youths, without provider discretion, parental or spousal consent (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\n. Most policies and national documents are vague on the age of consent for youths (i.e. age of consent) (Power et al., 2021). These documents do not explicitly state the youth’s legal right to freely and independently access a full range of contraceptive services, including LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Hence, health providers choosing to provide service to adolescents and youth are not protected by any policy statement that legally authorizes health providers to offer contraceptive services to this age group (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nFurthermore, the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy does not adequately recognize the large resource pool of providers within the healthcare system that can offer some LARC services (e.g., injectables) These healthcare providers include; the Junior Community Health Extension Worker (JCHEWs), Community Pharmacists, Community Midwives and PPMVs. Inclusion of these providers in the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy is vital as these cadre could play important roles in providing LARCs to women since in a large proportion of rural facilities, they may be the only available healthcare providers (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\nAnother policy challenge is the poor translation of existing policies to action (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). There is a recurrent challenge of timely and effective implementation of most policies/guidelines (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). This is especially so because the autonomy of adoption and implementation of policies made by the Federal Ministry of Health falls on the State Ministry of Health. For example, since the approval of the Task Shifting Policy in 2012, as at 2019, 13 states are yet to begin domestication (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). Likewise, for the National FP Blueprint, 14 states are yet to domesticate the plan to state level costed implementation plans since its launch in 2014 (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020).\n\nTable 1: Summary of policy challenges |——–|——–|——–|——————————————-|——–| | | | | | | | | S/N | | Policy Challenges | | | | | | | | | | 1. | | Inadequate policies supporting Adolescent and Youth Family Planning | | | | | | | | | | 2. | | Ambiguities in existing Family Planning policies (especially around adolescent and youth | | | | | | | | | | 3. | | Poor translation of existing policies to action | | | | | | | |\nSource: Nigeria Family Planning Blue Print (2020-2024), 2020."

    "section": "3.9 Programs and Initiatives",
    "text": "3.9 Programs and Initiatives\nSeveral programs and initiatives have been launched to support the government’s efforts to increase uptake of LARCs and utmostly achieve the national family planning goals of a modern contraceptive prevalence of 27 percent (Federal Ministry of Health, 2020). These programs have strikingly increased the provision of LARCs in Nigeria (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). The most recent includes:\n·        The Marie Stopes Nigeria “BlueStar” social franchising program (2012): This supports more than 300 private-sector providers, particularly in the South, of whom about 70% are midwives. The midwives in turn provided a notably large number of women—more than 65,000—with contraception, especially implants, in 2015.\n·        The Society for Family Health’s “Healthy Family Network social franchising program, with more than 300 service providers, has likewise been successful, although more with the IUDs.\n·        DKT International also launched a program that gives support to private providers, particularly in the South. Its model consists primarily of marketing contraceptive products to providers and distributors, without the networking and other components of social franchising. LARC sales in 2015 was at more than 100,000 which is striking.\n·        Marie Stopes Nigeria commenced a program focused on deploying “mobile outreach” teams in the North. These mobile outreaches typically occur in collaboration with the public sector and in public-sector sites. Remarkably, with only 8 outreach teams, they provided about 63,000 clients with LARCs in 2015, primarily implants\n·        Marie Stopes Nigeria also began the Family Health Plus initiative in 2014. It works with public-sector providers at the state level, now expanded to 20 states, emphasizing training, supportive supervision, and supply chain. Again, providing LARCs to more than 250,000 clients in 2015.\nMore than 550,000 women have received LARCs from just these 5 initiatives, representing over 2% of married women of reproductive age and 1.5% of all women of reproductive age in Nigeria (Shelton & Finkle, 2016).\nLARCs engender high rates of satisfaction and continuation, the sustained cumulative effect of these programs over a period of time would be substantial.  For instance, between 2014 and 2015, the share of overall modern contraceptive use for implants in Kaduna state (where Family Health Plus, Healthy Family Network, Marie Stopes Nigeria mobile outreach, and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative as well as others) are all active, increased from 16 percent to 28 percent (Nigeria - Kaduna and Lagos Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Survey, Round 2 2015 | GHDx, n.d.).\nFurthermore, these programs have provided proof for many vague concepts about LARC uptake in Nigeria. First, it can now be firmly stated that LARCs are highly acceptable for Nigerian women desiring contraception (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Second, promoting equity by providing LARC services in very low-income as well as higher-income clients is highly efficient (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). A precedent, indicates that 75 percent, 53 percent, and 49 percent of Marie Stopes Nigeria’s mobile outreach, Family Health Plus, and social franchising clients, respectively, were from households living on less than US$2.50 per day (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Third, success is attainable in every geographical zone in Nigeria. While it is generally held that the more conservative North is highly resistant to family planning, these projects—notably, mobile outreach and the Family Health Plus public-sector support project demonstrate that with concerted efforts, success can be achieved in the North as well (Shelton & Finkle, 2016). Fourth, the Family Health Plus program showed that despite the public sector’s reputation as a weak service delivery platform, when the private sector works closely with the government, public-sector service delivery on LARCs can be successful (Shelton & Finkle, 2016).\nTable 2: Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods by Selected Program Initiatives, Nigeria, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\nImplants\nIUDs\nTotal LARCs\n\n\nBlue Star (Marie Stopes Nigeria\n51,643\n13,811\n65,454\n\n\nHealthy Family Network (SFH)\n20,273\n53,900\n74,173\n\n\nDKT International Sales\n15,967\n87,600\n103,567\n\n\nMobile Outreaches (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n53,786\n9,200\n62,986\n\n\nFamily Health Plus (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n222,705\n29,686\n252,391\n\n\nTotal\n364,374\n194,197\n558,571\n\n\n\nSource: For Marie Stopes Nigeria - personal communication with Anna Mackay; Deputy Director of SIFPO Project for Marie Stopes International; for SFH - personal communication with Peter Entonu, (Associate Director of Social Franchise Unit); for DKT, sales report from December 2015.\nIn addition to the programs described above, a number of other worthwhile initiatives are ongoing in Nigeria, including traditional social marketing and clinic-based public-sector and NGO service (Shelton & Finkle, 2016)."

    "text": "ABSTRACT\nIt is projected that the global population will grow from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 8.5 billion in 2030, reaching 11 billion by the middle of the 21st century. This rise is a result of three processes, the key determinants of population growth: births (fertility), deaths (mortality), and movement (migration). Although women have had fewer kids in many parts of the world over the past few decades, amid numerous interventions, high fertility rates persist in sub-Saharan Africa. In these countries with lifetime fertility, up to half of the overall population growth worldwide is expected to remain well above two births per woman by 2050, although many countries will remain well above two births per woman. The primary fertility level measure is the total fertility rate (TFR), which shows the average number of children a woman can bear in her lifetime, based on current age-specific fertility rates. Data from the [1–4] were used for this study while a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to was used to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Findings from the study showed that postpartum infecundability remained the strongest influential factor in reducing fertility while sexual exposure and contraception have an inverse relationship with educational attainment levels in all years of the survey. However, if was found that contraception use had a more impact among women with higher education who lived in urban regions and belonged to the highest wealth quintile. The study, therefore suggested that the Government of Nigeria and developing partners need to design effective strategies to increase contraceptive use across the country.\nKeywords: fertility, determinants."

    "section": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:",
    "text": "3.2 Knowledge, Awareness and Attitude towards LARCs:\nThe Knowledge of long-acting reversible contraception was relatively low in comparison with other Sub-Saharan African countries; nevertheless, there have been remarkable improvement. (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). For instance, in 2003, only 27 percent of Nigerian women had heard of IUDs, 57 percent of Injectables and 10 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004) . Nonetheless, by 2018, 46 percent of women had heard of IUDs, 82 percent of Injectables and 70 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019).\nAwareness of LARCs varied with geographical location, wealth quintile and education levels. Women living in rural, and less literate North East and North West zones were least likely to be informed on any method of long-acting contraception (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). In contrast, women residing in urban Southern regions, (especially South West) were well-educated on the different LARCs available to them . Expectedly, low levels of education and household income led to reduced knowledge and awareness of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019).\nWomen obtained information on LARCs from various sources. Primarily, such information were from friends and family (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Ameh and Sule 2007; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Secondary sources include: radio/television/newspapers/magazines, school lectures/workshops/seminars and health workers (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Monjok et al. 2010; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olukoya 1991; Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005). This is interesting because first, it indicates the importance of ensuring that non-medical personnel have access to the right information on LARCs since most women are more likely to get their foremost information from informal sources (Olukoya 1991). Second, it also suggests that organizing community-directed outreaches centered on raising awareness and providing information on LARCs to community members may yield notable results since women are more inclined to learn about LARCs primarily from their immediate community (Olukoya 1991).\nIn a slightly different pattern, female students sourced their information on LARCs primarily from social media, lectures, seminars, friends, family and secondarily, from health workers (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). This may probably be due to the academic environment (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). The positive effect of this observation lies in the potential of increased awareness through seminar, workshops and social media adverts (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Copper T, Depo Provera®, Noristerat® and Implanon® were the most popular brands of LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012) among female students. Female students who had previous induced abortion were significantly more knowledgeable about LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Their experience of an induced abortion may have triggered the quest to obtain information on more effective and reliable ways of preventing unplanned pregnancies (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Parents often feel uncomfortable communicating issues bothering sex or in some cases, lack adequate information on LARCs. As a result, young females are more reluctant to get information on LARCs from them (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005).\nDifferent studies had contrasting views on the influence of religion on the knowledge of LARCs. Some studies reported the effect of religious beliefs on the knowledge, awareness and subsequent use of LARCs. For instance, Christian women were reportedly more aware of LARCs than women belonging to other religions in Nigeria (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olaleye et al. 2014; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011). However, this maybe not be a true reflection nationally, as due cognizance must be taken of a possible confounding of Christianity being the predominant religion in the regions of some of these studies (A. S. Adeyemi, Adekanle, and Komolafe 2008; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). In contrast, two studies conducted by Aduloju et al. (2021), and Orji and Onwudiegwu (2002) stated that religion, did not have any statistical significance (p &gt; 0.05) on the knowledge and awareness of LARCs.\nThe gap between the Knowledge of LARCs and its actual usage was widened (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002). The implication of this is that awareness alone does not determine the utilization of LARCs by Nigerian women (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002). The common reasons for this gap include: lack of knowledge on provider centers, distance from the source of LARCs, adequate information on the benefits of LARCs, fear of possible side effects, fear of the procedure, husband disapproval, religion and culture (Aduloju et al. 2021; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001).\nFigure 2: Knowledge of LARC methods. Source: NDHS 2003, NDHS 2008, NDHS 2013 & NDHS 2018\nThe acceptance and use of LARCs was largely dependent on the attitude of women (Aduloju et al. 2021). Women’s attitude (positive or negative) towards LARCs was primarily determined by their level of education and number of surviving children (especially sons). Improvement in health, maintenance of a smaller family size and the fact that it made life more comfortable steered a positive attitude in women which made them four times more likely to use LARCs (Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015). Some women frowned at LARCs because they viewed regulating their fertility as an unhealthy immoral behavior which is an affront to the God-given blessing of fertility (Renne 1997; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ukaegbu 1977).\nAnother contributing factor to the attitude of the women to LARCs was the viewpoint of health workers. For instance, although family planning and health workers may promote the use of LARCs like IUDs, some do so with reservations, advising women not to use IUDs if they have not had children before (Renne 1997)."

    "section": "3.3 Access to LARCs",
    "text": "3.3 Access to LARCs\nNigerian women seek long-acting reversible contraception from both public and private sectors (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). Government hospitals, government health centers and family planning clinics were major public health outlets for LARCs (Egede et al. 2015 ; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). While family/private hospital/clinics and private pharmacies, popularly called “chemist shops” were popular private sector outlets (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015 ; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). LARCs such as IUDs, Implants, and Injectables were primarily sourced from the public sector because they require trained service delivery (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019).\nThe ease of accessing LARCs, proximity of service providers and level of confidentiality offered by service providers were key considerations in choosing where to get LARCs, given that some women used LARCs without their husband’s knowledge or approval (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013). Patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops being the most proximate and accessible providers were the major sources of LARCs that do not require trained medical services.\nReligion and denomination also influenced the source of purchase. Reported that while Roman Catholics purchase LARCs chiefly from patent medicine shops, the majority of other Christians procure theirs from general hospitals (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). The patronage of patent medicine shops by Catholics maybe associated with a religious objection to the use of modern contraceptive methods and the desire to keep their purchase of LARCs “confidential.” Similarly, Muslims patronized patent medicine shops more frequently, also due to reported high disapproval by of contraceptives (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005).\nFigure 3: Source of LARCs (Public Sector). Source: NDHS 2018\nFigure 4: Source of LARCs (Private Sector). Source: NDHS, 2018\nThere were geographical differences in accessing LARCs. Urban dwellers procured LARCs from government hospitals, private clinics, and pharmacy shops with qualified pharmacists (Onwujekwe et al. 2013). In contrast, rural dwellers got theirs mostly from patent medicine dealers (Onwujekwe et al. 2013), probably due to the proximity of these patent medicine shops and high cost transportation from rural to urban regions where bigger health facilities are located. This trend of the patent medicine shops being the most popular source of LARCs in rural regions is worrisome, since most of the patent medicine dealers are untrained (Monjok et al. 2010)\nMost women held the opinion that LARCs were not easily accessible (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). However, the proportion of women who thought that LARCs were not readily accessible decreased consistently with increase in educational status and residence in urban areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, one can infer that with exposure to education, women become well informed on the various means of accessing LARCs and are financially capable of purchasing them.\nAlthough a good number of Nigerian women desire them (The RESPOND Project 2013), there are certain barriers to accessing the wide variety of LARCs available. First, is the reduced availability of LARCs in certain family planning clinics (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005; The RESPOND Project 2013). The RESPOND project, reported feedback by one of the service providers where she buttressed this challenge:\n“..Sometimes we run out of stock but not too frequently; when that happens, I will go into the market to get some so that we will have the methods, because we are mindful of our clients’ appointment dates…. I used to tell the community that the IUD is now costly because we used to get it from black market in Makurdi…” (The RESPOND Project 2013)\n—Service provider, Adikpo, Benue State, Nigeria\nThe lack of basic supplies and equipment most often lead providers to charge unauthorized fees that some women cannot afford or request clients to purchase LARC supplies from the black market notorious for its uncertain quality (The RESPOND Project 2013). Second, some family planning clinics are in a poor state of repair, and many had either no or only intermittent electricity all of which discourages women (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nThe third barrier to accessing LARCs is the shortage of skilled providers to deliver LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). For instance, although the policy that permits Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to deliver Injectables was approved in 2012, only few CHEWs have received formal training on how to deliver the method properly (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Regarding other LARCs, Implants were introduced on a larger scale in the public sector only in 2006, and it is plausible that many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public system (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Many experienced Family Planning (FP) providers cited the lack of continuing education and training as the reason for the rather reduced skill set in administering LARCs, pointing to the 1980s as the last time that large-scale FP training efforts were in place (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014)."

    "section": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence",
    "text": "3.4 Utilization/Geopolitical Prevalence\nThe contraceptive prevalence (CPR) of LARCs remain low relative to other short-acting contraceptives. Nevertheless, the CPR of LARCs increased steadily from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 7.4 percent in 2018 among married women using contraceptives (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019). Nationally, about 14.8 percent of women currently using any method of contraception used LARCs (Bolarinwa and Olagunju 2020). The prevalence LARCs was highest among women aged 35 years and above and lowest among those aged 15-24 (Ugboaja et al. 2011; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). Injectables and IUDs were the most frequently used LARC (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; BC Ozumba and Ibekwe 2001; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019).\n\nUse of LARCs varied with residence, region, level of education, number of living children, and economic status of the household (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). Married women residing in urban areas were more likely to use LARCs than their rural counterparts (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Onwuhafua et al. 2005). The limited use of LARCs in rural areas persists for various reasons ranging from unavailability of the LARC methods to lack of proﬁciency in administering LARCs by rural care providers (Onwuhafua et al. 2005). The South-West zone had the highest proportion of women using LARCs, followed by the South-South zone (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). The lowest proportion of married women using any LARC method were in the North-East (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). LARC use increased with educational attainment across all geopolitical zones (A. S. Adeyemi, Adekanle, and Komolafe 2008; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). By wealth quintile, women in the lowest quintile were least likely to use long-acting reversible contraception and women in the highest quintile were most likely to use them (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nUse of LARCs was relatively low among singles compared to married women (Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Olaleye et al. 2014; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). This may be because single women are less likely to source for contraception openly because of cultural and religious prohibition of premarital sex in Nigeria (Ijarotimi et al. 2015).\n\n\nThe uptake of LARCs increased with parity; women do not begin to use LARCs until they have had at least one child (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Konje et al. 1998; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002).\nAn attribute pointing to the reproductive need of women with less than 3 children and the popular consideration of LARC methods as an alternative to the sterilization method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015).\nThe most common reasons for using any method of long-acting reversible contraception were safety, reversibility, effectiveness, long-term protection, convenience, husband’s approval, understanding of the LARC method, personal choice, the desire to have good maternal health, satisfaction with information given on insertion procedure and services rendered by the healthcare provider recommendation by another woman who had used the method, affordability, approval by religion and duration of the desired LARC (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; The RESPOND Project 2013).\nLack of knowledge, not being married, fear of the procedure, dislike of foreign body, inability to access LARCs, husband’s objection, fear of side effects/complications, fear of infertility, need for further counselling, high cost of LARCs, preference for natural methods, lack of knowledge on provider centers, inadequate information on the benefits of LARCs, conﬂicts with their religious and cultural beliefs were the major reasons given by the women for not using LARCs (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Konje et al. 1998; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977). In their study, Eke and Alabi-Isama (2011) reported that most adolescent females thought that LARCs should not be used by unmarried women.\nMost women thought that negotiating and deciding with their husbands prior the use of any LARC method was necessary (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). But in reality, men alone played the dominant role in women’s decision to adopt long-acting reversible contraception and in the choice of method (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; The RESPOND Project 2013). The dominant role of men affected the use of LARCs because men generally demonstrated less favorable attitudes toward family planning than women and were less knowledgeable about LARCs (The RESPOND Project 2013). Hence, a woman’s ability to control her fertility and her choice of long-acting reversible contraception were partly determined by her empowerment status and self-image (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). A woman who is unable to control her life may be less likely to feel she can make and carry out decisions about her fertility (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nDepo Provera® and Noristerat® were the most commonly used brands of Injectables (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Depo Provera® was largely used by women in the South-East and North-West zones, while Noristerat® was primarily used by women in the North-East (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Notably, Depo Provera was the brand of choice for women in the lowest, second and fourth wealth quintile, who had either secondary, primary or no education (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Conversely, the use of Noristerat® increased with educational attainment and wealth status (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014).\nOver time, the use of Implants, particularly Implanon® and Jadelle® became popular (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Tunau et al. 2019). It even seems that Implants have slowly replaced IUDs which were commonly used earlier (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Tunau et al. 2019). Highly educated women preferred Implants and had higher odds of using them the less educated counterparts. The plausible motive for this preference maybe the increased capacity to manage information correctly by educated women and awareness of the associated advantages of using Implants education provides (Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020). Non-literate women appeared to be suspicious of new methods and therefore shunned the method (Mutihir and Duru 2008). Specifically, young Nigerian women with desire for future fertility formed significant proportion of Implanon® acceptors (Roberts et al. 2015).\nIUDs are quite common and widely used in Nigeria, particularly by older married women aged 35 and above (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005) but are gradually losing their appeal. They were least commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Religious constraints seem to be the major propeller behind this; Muslim women while not considering family planning as un-Islamic, often view the insertion of an external object into their body to be sacrilegious (Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984). Although still used in other regions in Nigeria, IUDs are gradually losing favor in the South-Western region (Ameh and Sule 2007; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). The need for their husband’s consent maybe one of the primary reasons for the general decline in the application of IUDs. The thread from the IUDs often give women away when using them without their husband’s consent (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). The most common reason for discontinuation was a desire for pregnancy, especially among those younger than 35 years (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). Married women were more likely to use IUDs than singles, as most singles opt for other forms of contraception (E. C. Ezugwu et al. 2020).\nNigerian women are most often not aware or have misconceptions on the benefits and side effects of long-acting reversible contraception (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, the need to heighten awareness, to enable women make informed decisions while choosing a LARC method. Women who used injectables and IUDs were more informed on the side effects of these methods, what to do if they experienced side effects and other methods of long-acting contraception available to them than women who opted for Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). LARC users were least likely to receive information about side effects or safety issues from a private medical facility than from a government hospital (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). The same was true of information on what to do if they experienced side effects. (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nAlthough some women were not current users, they indicated interest in using Injectables and IUDs in the future (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). The proportion of Nigerian women who were non-users, but intend to use a modern method of contraception (such as LARCs) in the future was lowest in the North-East. This was the same for uneducated women living in rural areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Knowledge of this is crucial in order to meet the rising demand for LARCs by Nigerian women. These statistics confirm that demand generation will be a critical component of meeting the national contraceptive prevalence goal (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014).\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

While there were a few reports of unintended pregnancies, the failure rate was very minimal, ranging from 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Although a relatively high failure rate of 3.7 percent was reported among IUD users in Abia State (Chigbu et al. 2010), unexpected pregnancy was observed in just one out of the 27 IUD users. Larger studies, however, revealed that IUDs, particularly Copper T-380A, were effective in over 99 percent of users (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; Fakeye 1991; Farr et al. 1996; Obi and Anya 2000). Similar high rates were found among users of progesterone-only injectables, notably Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Chigbu et al. 2010; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), and contraceptive subdermal implants, such as Implanon® (Balogun et al. 2014; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2015) Jadelle® (Enyindah and Kasso 2011) and Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ladipo et al. 1993; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010). A study in Jos reported one failure (3.3 percent) among 30 women who requested for and had Implanon® rods removed (Mutihir and Nyango 2010). However, this failure was due to inadvertent insertion of the implant during pregnancy."

    "section": "3.9 Discontinuation",
    "text": "3.9 Discontinuation\nThe discontinuation rate varied considerably across the different LARCs types and with the duration of usage. Unsurprisingly, there was an increase in discontinuation rates over time, particularly for injectables which typically require two-monthly or three-monthly administration. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation at 12 months of use was highest among women using DMPA injectables, ranging from 50 percent to 62 percent (Chigbu et al. 2010; Fakeye 1991; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ogedengbe et al. 1987). However, in Osogbo a slightly lower rate of 22.4 percent was observed (A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012). Interestingly, an Enugu study documented a low discontinuation rate (12.8 percent) even at 36 months (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Compared to injectables, implants and IUDs had better continuity owing to their longer life span. The 12-month discontinuation rate for IUDs was 10%-22% (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Fakeye 1991; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; van Dierendonck et al. 1992), while those for implants were 1-8 percent for Implanon® (Ezegwui et al. 2011; Mutihir and Duru 2008)and 5.4-9.8% for Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Fakeye 1991). Jadelle®, a relatively new contraceptive implant in Nigeria, had no discontinuations among users in Rivers State (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Ogedengbe et al. (1987), however, observed comparable discontinuation rates between IUDs (45.6%) and Injectables (50.2%). For Norplant®, after 36 months, approximately 11-18% of users had discontinued use (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998).\nSimilar to other contraceptives, LARCs are not without side effects. Side effects/health concerns were the primary reason for discontinuing LARCs. Common side effects like changes in menstrual cycle, irregular spotting of blood through the vagina and amenorrhea have been associated to the use of progestogen-only methods (Okafor 2018). To reduce the occurrence of side-effects and promote use, LARCs should be selected based on informed decisions. This is an important principle in the delivery of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). Women using LARCs should also be counseled, so they can cope easily with side effects, to avoid dissatisfactions and unnecessary discontinuations of the methods (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nThe most frequently reported reasons for discontinuing LARCs were the desire for pregnancy (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Ogedengbe et al. 1987; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008; van Dierendonck et al. 1992) and menstrual side effects (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998). Abnormal menstruation, particularly amenorrhea, was a commonly cited reason by users of contraceptive injectable (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012). Spousal factors such as husband’s objection and husband’s deaths were also linked with discontinuation (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). Expulsion of contraceptive devices was also reported among IUD users (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Fakeye 1991; Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ogedengbe et al. 1987)."

    "section": "3.10 Policies",
    "text": "3.10 Policies\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGON) have made considerably good strides in creating an enabling environment for LARCs to thrive (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). For instance, certain positive policy reforms have occurred, notably the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy which allows CHEWs to administer Injectables (they are still restricted from providing IUDs and implants) (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014, 2020). Additional reforms include making LARCs free in public-sector clinics and reforming the nurse/midwife training curriculum to make it proficiency-based and supported by rigorous supervision (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Shelton and Finkle 2016). These policy reforms yielded some success in the uptake of LARCs. For instance, between 2008 and 2013, the use of Implants increased from 0.4 to 3.4 percent (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Nigeria’s Family Planning Effort (FPE) ratings in 2014 also indicate notable progress in Policies and Access (Avenir Health 2016). Nevertheless, the country’s FPE scores, are still very low compared to other countries in the region (Avenir Health 2016). Hence, intensive efforts are needed to significantly improve Nigeria’s FP policy and program environment (Avenir Health 2016).\nCurrently, there are at least four plans with Family Planning/Reproductive Health goals associated with them. These are the National LARC Strategy, the Reproductive Health Commodity Strategy, the National Strategic Health Development Plan, and the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) Strategy (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Other important policies include the National Youth Policy 2009, Gender Policy 2008, National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria 2007, and the National School Health Policy 2006. The School Health Policy provides the framework for implementing the national school health program (Cortez et al. 2015).\nAdditionally, the FGON committed to further creating an enabling environment for family planning activities (including LARCs). This commitment was buttressed in the following actions: revitalizing its commitment in the 2017 Summit on Family Planning, developing a national guideline to scale-up private providers’ access to government’s free FP commodities, reviewing the National Reproductive Health Policy and The Reproductive Health Strategic Framework and developing an accelerated introduction and scale-up plan for the Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to increase access to injectable contraceptives (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nHowever, there are still some gaps in some of the policies, especially pertaining access to family planning services and rights to adolescents and youths (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Currently, reproductive health policies do not indicate unrestricted access to family planning (including LARCs) services for youths, without provider discretion, parental or spousal consent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). . Most policies and national documents are vague on the age of consent for youths (i.e. age of consent) [Power et al., 2021]. These documents do not explicitly state the youth’s legal right to freely and independently access a full range of contraceptive services, including LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Hence, health providers choosing to provide service to adolescents and youth are not protected by any policy statement that legally authorizes health providers to offer contraceptive services to this age group (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFurthermore, the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy does not adequately recognize the large resource pool of providers within the healthcare system that can offer some LARC services (e.g., injectables) These healthcare providers include; the Junior Community Health Extension Worker (JCHEWs), Community Pharmacists, Community Midwives and PPMVs. Inclusion of these providers in the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy is vital as these cadre could play important roles in providing LARCs to women since in a large proportion of rural facilities, they may be the only available healthcare providers (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother policy challenge is the poor translation of existing policies to action (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). There is a recurrent challenge of timely and effective implementation of most policies/guidelines (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). This is especially so because the autonomy of adoption and implementation of policies made by the Federal Ministry of Health falls on the State Ministry of Health. For example, since the approval of the Task Shifting Policy in 2012, as at 2019, 13 states are yet to begin domestication (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Likewise, for the National FP Blueprint, 14 states are yet to domesticate the plan to state level costed implementation plans since its launch in 2014 (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\n\nTable 1: Summary of policy challenges |——–|——–|——–|——————————————-|——–| | | | | | | | | S/N | | Policy Challenges | | | | | | | | | | 1. | | Inadequate policies supporting Adolescent and Youth Family Planning | | | | | | | | | | 2. | | Ambiguities in existing Family Planning policies (especially around adolescent and youth | | | | | | | | | | 3. | | Poor translation of existing policies to action | | | | | | | |\nSource: Nigeria Family Planning Blue Print (2020-2024), 2020."

    "section": "3.11 Programs and Initiatives",
    "text": "3.11 Programs and Initiatives\nSeveral programs and initiatives have been launched to support the government’s efforts to increase uptake of LARCs and utmostly achieve the national family planning goals of a modern contraceptive prevalence of 27 percent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These programs have strikingly increased the provision of LARCs in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016). The most recent includes:\n· The Marie Stopes Nigeria “BlueStar” social franchising program 2012: This supports more than 300 private-sector providers, particularly in the South, of whom about 70% are midwives. The midwives in turn provided a notably large number of women—more than 65,000—with contraception, especially implants, in 2015.\n· The Society for Family Health’s “Healthy Family Network social franchising program, with more than 300 service providers, has likewise been successful, although more with the IUDs.\n· DKT International also launched a program that gives support to private providers, particularly in the South. Its model consists primarily of marketing contraceptive products to providers and distributors, without the networking and other components of social franchising. LARC sales in 2015 was at more than 100,000 which is striking.\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria commenced a program focused on deploying “mobile outreach” teams in the North. These mobile outreaches typically occur in collaboration with the public sector and in public-sector sites. Remarkably, with only 8 outreach teams, they provided about 63,000 clients with LARCs in 2015, primarily implants\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria also began the Family Health Plus initiative in 2014. It works with public-sector providers at the state level, now expanded to 20 states, emphasizing training, supportive supervision, and supply chain. Again, providing LARCs to more than 250,000 clients in 2015.\nMore than 550,000 women have received LARCs from just these 5 initiatives, representing over 2% of married women of reproductive age and 1.5% of all women of reproductive age in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nLARCs engender high rates of satisfaction and continuation, the sustained cumulative effect of these programs over a period of time would be substantial. For instance, between 2014 and 2015, the share of overall modern contraceptive use for implants in Kaduna state (where Family Health Plus, Healthy Family Network, Marie Stopes Nigeria mobile outreach, and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative as well as others) are all active, increased from 16 percent to 28 percent [Nigeria - Kaduna and Lagos Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Survey, Round 2 2015 | GHDx, n.d.).\nFurthermore, these programs have provided proof for many vague concepts about LARC uptake in Nigeria. First, it can now be firmly stated that LARCs are highly acceptable for Nigerian women desiring contraception (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Second, promoting equity by providing LARC services in very low-income as well as higher-income clients is highly efficient (Shelton and Finkle 2016). A precedent, indicates that 75 percent, 53 percent, and 49 percent of Marie Stopes Nigeria’s mobile outreach, Family Health Plus, and social franchising clients, respectively, were from households living on less than US$2.50 per day (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Third, success is attainable in every geographical zone in Nigeria. While it is generally held that the more conservative North is highly resistant to family planning, these projects—notably, mobile outreach and the Family Health Plus public-sector support project demonstrate that with concerted efforts, success can be achieved in the North as well (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Fourth, the Family Health Plus program showed that despite the public sector’s reputation as a weak service delivery platform, when the private sector works closely with the government, public-sector service delivery on LARCs can be successful (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nTable 2: Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods by Selected Program Initiatives, Nigeria, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\nImplants\nIUDs\nTotal LARCs\n\n\nBlue Star (Marie Stopes Nigeria\n51,643\n13,811\n65,454\n\n\nHealthy Family Network (SFH)\n20,273\n53,900\n74,173\n\n\nDKT International Sales\n15,967\n87,600\n103,567\n\n\nMobile Outreaches (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n53,786\n9,200\n62,986\n\n\nFamily Health Plus (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n222,705\n29,686\n252,391\n\n\nTotal\n364,374\n194,197\n558,571\n\n\n\nSource: For Marie Stopes Nigeria - personal communication with Anna Mackay; Deputy Director of SIFPO Project for Marie Stopes International; for SFH - personal communication with Peter Entonu, (Associate Director of Social Franchise Unit); for DKT, sales report from December 2015.\nIn addition to the programs described above, a number of other worthwhile initiatives are ongoing in Nigeria, including traditional social marketing and clinic-based public-sector and NGO service (Shelton and Finkle 2016)."

    "text": "2.1 Data Sources\nWe used data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 for this study [1–4]. The survey is a nationally representative survey of Nigerian households. Women aged 15-49 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors who spent the previous night in the household. A total of 7,620; 33,385; 38,948 and 41,821 women aged 15-49 were interviewed in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 surveys. The survey collected various information from women including fertility preference, sexual activity, and reproductive history, alongside background characteristics.\nThe key background variables considered in this study were percentage of women with secondary education or above, percentage of women working in the labour force, percentage of women living in urban residence, percentage of women in different geographical zones. The TFR was calculated from births and exposure during the three years (36 months) prior to each woman’s month of interview. The nominal date of a TFR is the year of the survey, but the reference period is prior to that. The reference period for the proximate determinants is also prior to the date of interview except for contraception, which is based on current contraceptive use. In terms of synchronization, the link between fertility and contraception is problematic. For individual women, contraception affects subsequent fertility, but in the data, fertility s measured for an earlier date than contraception.\nFor the estimation of index of abortion, we used the total abortion rate (TAR) reported in a survey by Guttmacher Institute [17]. The survey estimated the TAR using data on delivery of abortion and post-abortion care services from a nationally representative sample of 772 health facilities in 2012. The TAR obtained from his study was kept constant for all years of the analysis – 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018."

    "section": "2.2 Data analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Data analysis\nThis study examines the contributions of biological and behavioural determinants to fertility change, as well as the effects of the socio-economic and geographic factors through which the determinants exert their influence. Statistical analyses for inputs in the model were performed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) and confirmed with published DHS reports for inputs available in the reports. The proximate determinants of fertility, potential fertility and background variables were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. In the following section we present detailed analysis of fertility differentials that quantifies the negative and positive effects of each of the socio-economic and geographic factors on fertility through various intermediate fertility variables.\n\n2.2.1 Proximate determinants: The Bongaart’s Model\nWe used a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Each of the determinants is assumed to independently inhibit fertility. In the original model, Bongarts identified the following: an index for marriage, contraception, abortion and post-partum infecundity and expressed TFR as the product of the four indices together with total fecundity (TF) - the average number of live births expected among women during their entire lifetime, [6].\n\\[\nTFR = C_m\\:*\\:C_{i}\\:*\\:C_{c}\\:*\\:C_{a}\\:*\\:TF\n\\]\nwhere, TFR is the total fertility rate, Cm is the index of proportion married, Ci is the index of post-partum infecundability, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Cc is the index of contraception. The indices only take values between 0 and 1. If the corresponding index is of no fertility inhibition effect, the index equals 1; an index of 0 which is not empirically proven, indicates total inhibition effect [6].\nA revision of this model attempted to account for overlaps between the determinants, specifically between postpartum amenorrhea and contraceptive use [7]. The revised framework used for this study includes five intermediate fertility variables; proportion sexually exposed, postpartum infecundability, contraception, induced abortion, and sterility which are key direct determinants of fertility. From the original model, the index of marriage was revised to include women who have been in a sexual union in the last month, use contraceptives, are pregnant or post-partum infecundable. This index was renamed index of sexual exposure [7]. The index of post-partum infecundability was modified to post-partum insusceptibility including both median duration of post-partum amenorrhea and post-partum abstinence. The index of abortion was revised by multiplying contraceptive prevalence with average use effectiveness of contraception [7].\nThe index of sterility was modified from proportion of women 45-49 years old who had no live births to the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund. Index of contraception was revised to the proportion of sexually active fecund women using contraceptives that do not overlap with those experiencing postpartum amenorrhea and the average effectiveness of contraception [7]. The revised equation relating the total fertility rate to the proximate determinants used in this study is expressed as:\n\\[\nTFR=PF\\:*\\:C_{x}\\:*\\:C_{u}\\:*C_{a}\\:*C_{i}\\:*C_{f}\\:\n\\]\nWhere TFR is the total fertility rate, PF is the potential fertility, Cx represents the index of sexual exposure, Cu is the index of contraception, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Ci is the index of postpartum insusceptibility and Cf represents the index of sterility. Estimates from empirical data showed an average potential fertility of 21 (18-24) births per woman for the 35-year reproductive period from age 15 to 49 years [7]. Nonetheless, estimates of PF may exceed its theoretical limits because of a large error term in the proximate determinants’ framework, attributed in a large part to the effects of unmeasured factors exogenous to the framework [18].\n\n\n2.2.2 The index of sexual exposure (Cx)\nThe index of sexual exposure expresses the reduction in fertility caused by women’s not being sexually active throughout their entire reproductive period. The index is calculated as:\n\\[\nC_x=\\:s\n\\]\nwhere s is the proportion of women aged 15-49 who are sexually active (women who either are pregnant, report sex in the last month, use contraception, or are postpartum infecundable). The index of sexual exposure, Cx, equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are sexually active during the entire reproductive period and 0 in the absence of such.\n\n\n2.2.3 The index of contraception (Cc)\nThis considers both the level of contraceptive prevalence and the average effectiveness of contraceptive methods used. It is estimated as:\n\\[\nC_c=\\:1\\:-\\:1.08ue\n\\]\nwhere u is the proportion of women in the reproductive ages who are currently using contraception among those sexually active, excluding exclude those infecund and postpartum amenorrhic within 6 months after birth; and e is the average of use-effectiveness of contraception as practiced in the population. Estimates of the method-specific effectiveness are: sterilization (0.995), pill (0.930), injectable (0.970), implant (0.999), intra-uterine device (0.993), male condom (0.870), and other modern methods (0.800) [19].\n\n\n2.2.4 The index of sexual abortion (Ca)\nThe index of abortion is the proportion by which the PF is reduced due to induced abortion. Births averted per induced abortion are related to contraceptive use [18]. The index of abortion is defined as the ratio of the observed TFR to the estimated TFR without induced abortion, and declines with increasing incidence of induced abortion [7]. This index is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nC_a=\\frac{TFR}{TFR\\:+\\:0.4\\:*\\:(1\\:+\\:u)\\:*\\:TAR}\n\\]\nwhere TFR is the total fertility rate, u represents the proportion protected by contraception among women who have an induced abortion and TAR is the total abortion rate which is the average number of induced abortions per married or in-union woman at the end of the reproductive period if induced abortions remain at prevailing levels. The index of induced abortion equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Reliable data on the total abortion rate for all years is not available. We assumed abortion rates prevailing in 2012 [17], will remain constant throughout 2018.\n\n\n2.2.5 The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci)\nThe index of postpartum infecundability represents the reduced risk of exposure to conception immediately following a birth [20]. In the absence of any breastfeeding (and postpartum abstinence), the average birth interval is around 20 months, which includes four segments: a period of postpartum amenorrhea (1.5 months), the average waiting time to conception (7.5 months), time added by spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months) and 9 months of a full term pregnancy. The last three segments are assumed constant and sum up to 18.5 months. Postpartum amenorrhea is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. The index of postpartum infecundability is estimated by the ratio of the average birth interval where breastfeeding and abstinence are absent, and the length of a birth interval where the period of postpartum infecundability is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. It is estimated using the formula:\n\\[\nC_i\\:=\\:\\frac{20}{18.5\\:+\\:i}\n\\]\nwhere Ci = index of postpartum infecundability; and i = average duration of postpartum infecundability due to breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence. In the absence of breastfeeding and abstinence, i would be equal to 1.5, its minimum possible value, and Ci would equal 1. As the duration of postpartum infecundability increases, Ci declines and it would tend towards 0 if the duration of postpartum infecundability were to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n2.2.6 The index of sterility (Cs)\nCs measures the incidence of natural infertility and pathological sterility. This index expresses the total effect of infecundity because of a pathological condition. The net effect of pathological sterility would be the difference between the actual index and some base value that represents natural infecundity. The formula for measuring the index of sterility is represented as:\n\\[\nC_f~=\\:1\\:-\\:f\n\\]\nwhere f is defined as the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund."

These were the level of education, female participation in the workforce, wealth quintile, geopolitical regions and type of residence. Each of these factors has well established associations with fertility [21]. We examined fertility preferences through the ideal number of children and desire for more children. The DHS asks women with living children, “If you could go back to the time [when] you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” For women who are yet to give birth, the question is framed as “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019). We considered only numeric responses. The survey also asked women whether they wanted more children in addition to those they have, thus reflecting desire for further reproduction.\nThe study also tracked four indicators of women’s fertility preferences. The key indicators that reflect fertility-related international policy and program priorities include planning status for most recent birth in the past five years, percent of children born to mothers under age 18, percent of children born to mothers over age 34, and the median length of the birth interval (in months). We assessed the strength of Nigeria’s Family planning programs using the Family Planning Effort Index (FPEI) and National Composite Index on Family Planning (NCIFP). The FPE has been collected periodically since 1972, and provides results across four key components: policies, services, evaluation, and access [22]. The index was developed to measure the level of effort that goes into FP programs, and to track how these changes over time. The NCIPF measures the existence and implementation of family planning policies and program under five components: strategy, data, quality, equity, and accountability. It is built on the FPEIS framework [23]."

    "text": "2.4 Results\nThe indices of direct biological and behavioural determinants of fertility from Bongaarts models is shown in Table 1. The behavioural indices include index of sexual exposure (Cx), index of contraception (Cc)and index of abortion (Ca) while the index of sterility (Cs) is a biological determinant. Postpartum infecundability (Ci) is a function of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence. The duration of amenorrhea is a function of the normal length of amenorrhea after childbirth women which is due to breastfeeding practices. The duration of abstinence is entirely behavioural.\n\n\n\nEstimated Indices for Proximate Determinants of Fertility, DHS\n2003-2018YearCxCiCaCfCuPFSurvey TFRModel TFR20030.700.590.940.810.8521.005.655.6520080.700.620.940.820.8220.725.725.8020130.720.640.940.800.8119.485.505.9320180.680.640.940.800.8219.615.295.67Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2003-2018\n\n\nCi was the lowest among the indices in our study at 0.64 in the 2018 survey. This implies that postpartum infecundability is associated with reduction of potential fertility by 36% from its biological maximum. Delayed sexual exposure (Cx) inhibited fertility by 32% being the second most effective ferility reducing factor. The index of abortion was high at 0.94. Hence, abortion [24–26]. This index is therefore excluded from the discussions. The other reductions in PF occurred because of inability to bear children (Cf, 0.80) and effects from the use of contraceptive technologies (Cu, 0.82). The lowest contributor is the index of contraception, contributing to 18% reduction in PF. There were little changes during the period of the survey in the 5 indices.\nThe revised Bongaart’s model gave an estimated TFR of 5.67, which is 0.38 children higher than TFR measured by DHS survey in 2018 (5.29). The analysis arrived at similar values for 2003 (5.65 each). Any difference between these sets of TFRs may be due to underestimation in DHS samples, inaccuracies in the data, inexactitude in our estimation of the indices, or other factors left out of the model. Nevertheless, the model shows the relative contributions of the determinants, and enables us report variations between socio-economic and geographic groups, as well as changes over the years of the surveys 2003-2018.\nThe influence of the proximate determinants and their variability by these background factors are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2003 respectively. The study shows that for 2018, attainment of secondary education is associated with relatively low indices for sexual exposure (0.58) and contraception (0.62). Across the educational attainment levels, these two indices have an inverse relationship in all years of the survey. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability increases with additional educational attainment. This would reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Concerning disparity in place of residence and wealth, Cx was higher among rural residents in all years (rural - 0.74, urban - 061). This means sexual exposure inhibited fertility by 33.5% among rural residents, and 39% among city dwellers. On the contrary, the Ci was higher among urban residents (rural - 0.61, urban - 0.68). Contribution of sterility to reducing PF is not dependent on place of residence, as Cf in all years were within ±0.03 units. As expected, the index of contraception is higher in rural areas relative to urban population, reflecting a higher contraceptive use among sexually exposed female urban dwellers. There also are notable differences between women of different wealth quintiles. The values of the indices are lower for women in higher wealth quintiles, meaning a higher depression of fertility, with exception of Ci. The Ci increases progressively along the wealth quintiles (lowest - 0.56, second - 0.61, middle - 0.64, fourth - 0.68, highest - 0.75) in 2018, as well as across all the years of the survey.\nWorkforce participation is associated with a lower fertility in 2018, with no notable difference in preceding years. In the latest year of the survey, the estimated TFR among women in workforce was 5.22, compared to 5.93 in women without workforce participation. In 2013 however, the reverse was the case (in workforce - 5.76, not in workforce - 5.62) The differences were negligible in 2008 (in workforce – 5.93, not in workforce - 5.99), and 2003 (in workforce - 5.78, not in workforce - 5.74). In all years, the index of contraception contributed more to depression of fertility among those in workforce compared to those not active in workforce. In contrast, the index of marriage and index of sterility contributed more to fertility reduction among women of reproductive age not active in workforce. The contributions of the index of postpartum infecundability and index of abortion were near identical.This study also attempts to examine the effects of inputs into Nigeria’s family planning program on fertility reduction. The family planning effort index (FEPI) score increased between 1972 and 1999, then reduced through 2009, before increasing to 41% in 2014. The increase in FEPI to its all-time highest in 1999 corresponds to the lowest survey TFR recorded in Nigeria, 5.11 in 1999 [27]. During this time, access to contraceptives was high at 70.3%, and evaluation of services rendered stood at 81.4% (see Supplementary Information). The FEPI has since been replaced by another measure, the National Composite Index on Family Planning, NCIFP (see Supplementary Information). The most recent NCIFP in 2017 assessed the strategy (score - 62.4%), data (65.5%), quality (62.0%), accountability (39.0%) and equity (58.0%) of family planning in Nigeria. On all measures, the scores in 2017 (composite index - 62.4%) were higher than those in 2014 (composite index - 49.5%).\n\n\n\nNigeria Family Planning Effort Scores - This indicator is based on the aggregate of four dimensions of family planning effort (policies, services, evaluation, and method access). The raw scores were converted to percentages and are reported\n\n\nLastly, the study includes some outcome indicators. The state of planning for new births and incidence of births among the young and aged population are a reflection of policy priorities concerning reproductive options available to women. [21]. Among 12.2% of women aged 15-49 years with at least one child, the most recent birth was planned i.e. they wanted to have their last child at the time. There has been no notable increase in the median birth interval. The percentage of births to women less than 18 years of age has steadily reduced from 8.9% in 2003 to 6.0% in 2018. Overall, after an initial increase between 2003 and 2008, the percentage of births to women older than 34 years has remained relatively unchanged.\n\n\n\nSome Women Reproductive Options Outcome IndicatorsOutcome Indicator2003200820132018Proportion that planned most recent birth (%)16.711.99.812.2Median birth intervals (in months)31.231.331.730.9Proportion of births to women &lt;18 years (%)8.97.37.16.0Proportion of births to women &gt;34 years (%)14.415.315.315.0"

    "text": "3.7 Safety Profile and Complications\nWhile LARCs were generally reported to be safe, the chief complaints were menstrual abnormalities (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; F. O.

Secondary amenorrhea was the most prevalent menstrual disturbance among women using progesterone-only injectables (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008) and reported to a lesser extent by users of IUDs (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and subdermal implants (Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Roberts et al. 2015). One study in Enugu, however, reported amenorrhea as the main side effect experienced by Jadelle® users (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Other menstrual disturbances associated with the use of LARCs include irregular bleeding, heavy/prolonged bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Also frequently reported complaints were lower abdominal pain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Aisien 2007; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and vaginal discharge. Breast pain was also reported with the use of implants (Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014). There were also considerable cases of weight gain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and a far lesser proportion of weight loss (Chigbu et al. 2010; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) among women using contraceptive injectables. Interestingly, there were a few reports of weight gain in users of IUDs and Implant, with one study in Jos reporting an average weight gain of 2.6kg among users of Copper T-380A (Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006). Meanwhile, Sagay et al. suggested that Norplant tends to prolong PR and QRS electrocardiogram intervals (Sagay et al. 2008). Similarly, hypertension was associated with the use of injectables (Akadri and Odelola 2017; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010), though report. Expulsion and missing IUDs were also reported in a few studies (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Obi and Anya 2000; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009)."

    "section": "3.8 Barriers to use of LARCs",
    "text": "3.8 Barriers to use of LARCs\nShortage of skilled providers to deliver available LARC services is a major barrier to the uptake of LARCs. As stated earlier, only few approved CHEWs have actually received formal training on delivering injectables (i.e., providing the necessary counselling, screening for pregnancy, and delivering the actual injection) [29]. In the North, women rely on CHEWs with at least two years of post-secondary school education as the primary point of care (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). In addition to their primary responsibility in delivering LARCs, these CHEWs often function as the sole staff members of Primary Health Care Centers, providing all the care in the community and sometimes delivering services for which they are not properly trained (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). As at October 2018, 65 percent of Nigerian health facilities have a LARC-trained service provider (Bietsch, Williamson, and Reeves 2020). But only 36 percent of these facilities provided LARCs to women at the same period. This shortage maybe because many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public sector or that commodities, tool and job aids for delivering services are unavailable (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013, 2020).\nSome studies indicated that many service providers contributed to barriers to uptake by restricting access, based on their personal cultural/social norms or client’s personal characteristics (i.e. age, parity, and marital status) (Camara et al. 2017; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). A 2017 study which reviewed restrictions to contraceptive access imposed by service providers (nurses/midwives, patent and proprietary medicine vendors, CHEWs and pharmacists), showed that service preferences were given to clients who were married or older than 24yrs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). Similarly, the performance monitoring for action (PMA) 2020’s Adolescents and Young Adults Health Brief indicated that unmarried individuals might be able to services for male condoms and emergency contraceptives – but are less likely to access same for LARCs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). As a result, unmarried individuals might choose not to use LARCs or opt for methods that are more likely accessible but less effective (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). The unavailability of adequate youth-friendly Family Planning service points may be the biggest factor in preventing adolescents from accessing LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother salient barrier to the uptake of LARCs which has most often been over-looked is the poor integration of family planning services (including LARCs) with maternal and new-born health, childhood immunization, nutrition programmes and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Although during pregnancy, women may not actively seek FP information or services, but they often engage proactively with the healthcare system during antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and ﬁrst year infant immunizations (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These contact points offer valuable and reliable opportunities for healthcare providers to educate the women on LARC services. Some of the challenges of integration of FP with Maternal and Newborn & Child Health (MNCH) include resistance within the separate health programme responsible for FP and Maternal and Child Health services, facility or community-based workers who are not trained or have inadequate staff time to address both MNCH and FP needs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nIncreased stock-outs of commodities due to unavailability or poor quality of actual consumption data to determine the true commodity need, delays in approving the supply plan to commence procurement, poorly implemented annual supply plans and irregular last mile distribution mostly due to lack of funding, limits the provision of quality LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFear of side effects—real or perceived—is another key barrier hindering the use of LARCs. For example, some women fear that some methods cause excessive bleeding and infertility (Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; The RESPOND Project 2013; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002). There were common beliefs that if a woman does not give birth to all the children in her womb, she may develop cancer (The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Another commonly held opinion is that a couple should not use any family planning methods early in their childbearing years, to avoid infertility. Some men fear that women become promiscuous when they practice family planning (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nLack of support from the husband not only hinders initial contraceptive use but may also lead to pre- mature termination of use of a long-acting method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013). To resolve this and achieve their birth-limiting goals, some women use contraceptive methods covertly, although such behavior may result in serious marital disharmony if the husband learns of it (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nOther barriers to the use of LARCs include cultural bias (certain cultures are highly supportive of large family size), myths and misconceptions about LARCs, gender inequity, religious beliefs, fear of infection and reduction/loss of libido (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977)."

    "section": "2.5 Discussion",
    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nThis study used the revised Bongaarts model to show contributions of biological and behavioural determinants of fertility in Nigeria, and the effects of selected socio-economic and geographical variables. Specifically, the results measured the effect of sexual exposure, use of contraception, post-partum infecundability, abortion and sterility on reducing a potential fertility level of 21 births per woman.\nCultural and socio-economic differentials in the TFR trend exist and mean the decline has been uneven with a larger family size more desired in the north than the south [28]. A study in Kaduna State reported less than 20% of women wanted less than 5 children and 69% citing 5-14 children as ideal [29]. This difference in fertility pattern can be attributed to early marriage prevalent in the Northern part of Nigeria [30,31]. In addition to the geographical disparity, there are considerable differences in rates among ethnic and socio-economic groups [32]. TFR rates are lower among women who live in urban areas, women who have a secondary school education, and women who belong to households in higher or highest wealth quintiles [14].\nOur results showed that postpartum infecundability remained the strongest influential factor in reducing fertility from 2003 to 2018 . These results are similar to previous studies in Nigeria [12,13].\nAnalysis on the effect of education, geographical location (residence and region), workforce cadre and wealth quintile showed that high income earning women who were more educated and resided in urban regions were least affected by postpartum infecundability in comparison with the rural, poor and less educated women. This may be correlated with shorter durations of breastfeeding probably due to the intense work schedules common in urban areas which in turn lead to reduced period of postpartum amenorrhea. This is similar to analysis on the World Fertility Survey and Demographic and Health Survey by Chola and Michelo [10].\nFindings from a study conducted among the major Nigerian ethnic groups - Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa [33] using the original Bongartz’s model, suggested that the main fertility-inhibiting variables among the Igbos were marriage [11] (due to delayed marriage evident in this region), contraception use, and post-partum infecundability due to post-partum amenorrhea [11]. This is similar to our results, as the region predominantly occupied by Igbos i.e. South-East had similar patterns from 2003-2018 – with delayed sexual exposure having the most fertility inhibiting effect probably due to the prevalent system of late marriage in this region.\nIn contrast, although in the afore-mentioned study, post-partum infecundability was the main fertility inhibiting variable among the Yoruba and Hausa ethnic groups, followed by the marriage index and contraceptive use - having an effect among Yorubas only [11]. The use of contraception, post-partum infecundablity and sexual exposure respectively reduced fertility effectively from 2013-2018 which maybe as a result of increased level of education and probable awareness of different contraception methods in this region [34] This suggests that the most effective proximate determinants vary with location and ethnic classification. Hence, attempts to make uniform policies for fertility reduction and other health-related issues should consider the differences in social and cultural background of Nigeria.\nThe results also showed that sexual exposure was the second most influential factor in reducing fertility especially in the Southern region of Nigeria. This could be attributed to the considerably high effectiveness of contraception among sexually exposed women in this region with about 77% of the contraceptives proven effective from 2003 to 2018 which coincides with findings from Dev et al., (2016). The most common modern methods included the male condoms (18.9%), implants (17.4%) and injectables (17.0%). This suggests that family planning methods targeted at sexually exposed women may have a huge impact on fertility reduction.\nThe proportion of births inhibited because of contraception is higher in 2003 (32%) when compared to what was seen in 2018 (30%). This difference in the inhibition of fertility could be explained by the differences in the number of sexually exposed women which was 70.2% in 2003 and 68.2% in 2018.\nIn our current study, sterility played the third role in reducing fertility. In 2003, it accounted for 19% in decreasing fertility and by 2018, it slightly increased to 20%.\nVariation in education levels, wealth quintile, being a member of the workforce, region and place of residence, among the study participants between the regions could have brought changes in awareness which in turn influenced the index of contraception as noted in our results. In this study, contraception use had a higher impact among women with higher education who lived in urban regions and belonged to the highest wealth quintile. This is because women who are in the afore- mentioned category tend to delay marriage and are more likely to use modern methods of contraception [35].\nContrary to most studies on fertility determinants in Sub-Saharan Africa [10]; [36]], measurement of abortion was possible in this study. Induced abortion had a limited effect in reducing fertility accounting for only 6% in fertility reduction from 2003-2018. This maybe because induced abortion is illegal in Nigeria except when performed to save a woman’s life [17]. In our study, the inhibitory effect was more evident in women who are highly educated, live in urban areas, belong to the workforce and live in urban areas probably due to increased educational attainment and access to certain facilities. The illegal status and the availability of induced abortion have highly influenced the impact of the abortion variable on fertility in Nigeria. The South-South rank second in the proportions of women using any contraceptive method (29%) [17] and any modern method (18%), it also has the second highest level of unmet need (18%) [17]. Compared with women in other regions, those in the South-South may be relying on abortion to a greater degree, and on contraception to a lesser degree, to achieve the smaller families they desire Hence, the high inhibitory effect of abortion noted in this region.\nThe most recent index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate that the program efforts have increased only slightly. The decline noted in the 2009 FEPI scores could be attributed to poor record of actual access to contraceptive methods for most of the population [37]. However, by 2014, the scores improved (see Supplementary Information). Three out of four components had high scores, with The Policies component improving the most [38]. These scores simply imply that Nigeria ought to gear much of her efforts on creating mechanisms at the national, subnational, and facility level to monitor access to voluntary, non-discriminatory Family Planning information and services. Additionally, ensure equity of services to all members of interested population [38].\nOur findings showed that the median birth interval remained fairly constant at less than 2 years (&gt; 34 months) from 2003 to 2018. This is against the recommended 3 to 5 year interval [ref]."

    "text": "2.6 Conclusion\nFrom our study, it was discovered that among the four proximate determinants of fertility, postpartum infecundability played an important role in influencing fertility. It had the highest fertility inhibiting effect accounting for about 34% fertility reduction. The index of sexual exposure in 2003, 2008 and 2013 played an important role in inhibiting fertility. Contraception use had a higher impact among women with higher education and wealth quintile.\nTherefore, the Federal Government of Nigeria and developing partners need to design effective strategies to increase contraceptive use across the country. State-specific policies needs to be developed to address fertility levels across Nigeria. Increasing access to family planning information, services, and methods is essential. Providing high quality family planning services, commodities to support those services, and communication and messaging around family planning all require financial resources. It is critical that enough funds are provided to support these efforts.\nThese approaches ought to be specific to the different geopolitical zones since There are varying behavioural and proximate determinants unique to these regions.

    "text": "ABSTRACT\nIt is projected that the global population will grow from 7.7 billion in 2019 to 8.5 billion in 2030, reaching 11 billion by the middle of the 21st century. This rise is a result of three processes, the key determinants of population growth: births (fertility), deaths (mortality), and movement (migration). Although women have had fewer kids in many parts of the world over the past few decades, amid numerous interventions, high fertility rates persist in sub-Saharan Africa. In these countries with lifetime fertility, up to half of the overall population growth worldwide is expected to remain well above two births per woman by 2050, although many countries will remain well above two births per woman. The primary fertility level measure is the total fertility rate (TFR), which shows the average number of children a woman can bear in her lifetime, based on current age-specific fertility rates. Data from the [1–4] were used for this study while a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to was used to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Findings from the study showed that postpartum infecundability remained the strongest influential factor in reducing fertility while sexual exposure and contraception have an inverse relationship with educational attainment levels in all years of the survey. However, if was found that contraception use had a more impact among women with higher education who lived in urban regions and belonged to the highest wealth quintile. The study, therefore suggested that the Government of Nigeria and developing partners need to design effective strategies to increase contraceptive use across the country.\nKeywords: fertility, determinants."

    "text": "2.1 Data Sources\nWe used data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 for this study [1–4]. The survey is a nationally representative survey of Nigerian households. Women aged 15-49 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors who spent the previous night in the household. A total of 7,620; 33,385; 38,948 and 41,821 women aged 15-49 were interviewed in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 surveys. The survey collected various information from women including fertility preference, sexual activity, and reproductive history, alongside background characteristics.\nThe key background variables considered in this study were percentage of women with secondary education or above, percentage of women working in the labour force, percentage of women living in urban residence, percentage of women in different geographical zones. The TFR was calculated from births and exposure during the three years (36 months) prior to each woman’s month of interview. The nominal date of a TFR is the year of the survey, but the reference period is prior to that. The reference period for the proximate determinants is also prior to the date of interview except for contraception, which is based on current contraceptive use. In terms of synchronization, the link between fertility and contraception is problematic. For individual women, contraception affects subsequent fertility, but in the data, fertility s measured for an earlier date than contraception.\nFor the estimation of index of abortion, we used the total abortion rate (TAR) reported in a survey by Guttmacher Institute [17]. The survey estimated the TAR using data on delivery of abortion and post-abortion care services from a nationally representative sample of 772 health facilities in 2012. The TAR obtained from his study was kept constant for all years of the analysis – 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018."

    "section": "2.2 Data analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Data analysis\nThis study examines the contributions of biological and behavioural determinants to fertility change, as well as the effects of the socio-economic and geographic factors through which the determinants exert their influence. Statistical analyses for inputs in the model were performed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) and confirmed with published DHS reports for inputs available in the reports. The proximate determinants of fertility, potential fertility and background variables were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. In the following section we present detailed analysis of fertility differentials that quantifies the negative and positive effects of each of the socio-economic and geographic factors on fertility through various intermediate fertility variables.\n\n2.2.1 Proximate determinants: The Bongaart’s Model\nWe used a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Each of the determinants is assumed to independently inhibit fertility. In the original model, Bongarts identified the following: an index for marriage, contraception, abortion and post-partum infecundity and expressed TFR as the product of the four indices together with total fecundity (TF) - the average number of live births expected among women during their entire lifetime, [6].\n\\[\nTFR = C_m\\:*\\:C_{i}\\:*\\:C_{c}\\:*\\:C_{a}\\:*\\:TF\n\\]\nwhere, TFR is the total fertility rate, Cm is the index of proportion married, Ci is the index of post-partum infecundability, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Cc is the index of contraception. The indices only take values between 0 and 1. If the corresponding index is of no fertility inhibition effect, the index equals 1; an index of 0 which is not empirically proven, indicates total inhibition effect [6].\nA revision of this model attempted to account for overlaps between the determinants, specifically between postpartum amenorrhea and contraceptive use [7]. The revised framework used for this study includes five intermediate fertility variables; proportion sexually exposed, postpartum infecundability, contraception, induced abortion, and sterility which are key direct determinants of fertility. From the original model, the index of marriage was revised to include women who have been in a sexual union in the last month, use contraceptives, are pregnant or post-partum infecundable. This index was renamed index of sexual exposure [7]. The index of post-partum infecundability was modified to post-partum insusceptibility including both median duration of post-partum amenorrhea and post-partum abstinence. The index of abortion was revised by multiplying contraceptive prevalence with average use effectiveness of contraception [7].\nThe index of sterility was modified from proportion of women 45-49 years old who had no live births to the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund. Index of contraception was revised to the proportion of sexually active fecund women using contraceptives that do not overlap with those experiencing postpartum amenorrhea and the average effectiveness of contraception [7]. The revised equation relating the total fertility rate to the proximate determinants used in this study is expressed as:\n\\[\nTFR=PF\\:*\\:C_{x}\\:*\\:C_{u}\\:*C_{a}\\:*C_{i}\\:*C_{f}\\:\n\\]\nWhere TFR is the total fertility rate, PF is the potential fertility, Cx represents the index of sexual exposure, Cu is the index of contraception, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Ci is the index of postpartum insusceptibility and Cf represents the index of sterility. Estimates from empirical data showed an average potential fertility of 21 (18-24) births per woman for the 35-year reproductive period from age 15 to 49 years [7]. Nonetheless, estimates of PF may exceed its theoretical limits because of a large error term in the proximate determinants’ framework, attributed in a large part to the effects of unmeasured factors exogenous to the framework [18].\n\n\n2.2.2 The index of sexual exposure (Cx)\nThe index of sexual exposure expresses the reduction in fertility caused by women’s not being sexually active throughout their entire reproductive period. The index is calculated as:\n\\[\nC_x=\\:s\n\\]\nwhere s is the proportion of women aged 15-49 who are sexually active (women who either are pregnant, report sex in the last month, use contraception, or are postpartum infecundable). The index of sexual exposure, Cx, equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are sexually active during the entire reproductive period and 0 in the absence of such.\n\n\n2.2.3 The index of contraception (Cc)\nThis considers both the level of contraceptive prevalence and the average effectiveness of contraceptive methods used. It is estimated as:\n\\[\nC_c=\\:1\\:-\\:1.08ue\n\\]\nwhere u is the proportion of women in the reproductive ages who are currently using contraception among those sexually active, excluding exclude those infecund and postpartum amenorrhic within 6 months after birth; and e is the average of use-effectiveness of contraception as practiced in the population. Estimates of the method-specific effectiveness are: sterilization (0.995), pill (0.930), injectable (0.970), implant (0.999), intra-uterine device (0.993), male condom (0.870), and other modern methods (0.800) [19].\n\n\n2.2.4 The index of sexual abortion (Ca)\nThe index of abortion is the proportion by which the PF is reduced due to induced abortion. Births averted per induced abortion are related to contraceptive use [18]. The index of abortion is defined as the ratio of the observed TFR to the estimated TFR without induced abortion, and declines with increasing incidence of induced abortion [7]. This index is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nC_a=\\frac{TFR}{TFR\\:+\\:0.4\\:*\\:(1\\:+\\:u)\\:*\\:TAR}\n\\]\nwhere TFR is the total fertility rate, u represents the proportion protected by contraception among women who have an induced abortion and TAR is the total abortion rate which is the average number of induced abortions per married or in-union woman at the end of the reproductive period if induced abortions remain at prevailing levels. The index of induced abortion equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Reliable data on the total abortion rate for all years is not available. We assumed abortion rates prevailing in 2012 [17], will remain constant throughout 2018.\n\n\n2.2.5 The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci)\nThe index of postpartum infecundability represents the reduced risk of exposure to conception immediately following a birth [20]. In the absence of any breastfeeding (and postpartum abstinence), the average birth interval is around 20 months, which includes four segments: a period of postpartum amenorrhea (1.5 months), the average waiting time to conception (7.5 months), time added by spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months) and 9 months of a full term pregnancy. The last three segments are assumed constant and sum up to 18.5 months. Postpartum amenorrhea is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. The index of postpartum infecundability is estimated by the ratio of the average birth interval where breastfeeding and abstinence are absent, and the length of a birth interval where the period of postpartum infecundability is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. It is estimated using the formula:\n\\[\nC_i\\:=\\:\\frac{20}{18.5\\:+\\:i}\n\\]\nwhere Ci = index of postpartum infecundability; and i = average duration of postpartum infecundability due to breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence. In the absence of breastfeeding and abstinence, i would be equal to 1.5, its minimum possible value, and Ci would equal 1. As the duration of postpartum infecundability increases, Ci declines and it would tend towards 0 if the duration of postpartum infecundability were to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n2.2.6 The index of sterility (Cs)\nCs measures the incidence of natural infertility and pathological sterility. This index expresses the total effect of infecundity because of a pathological condition. The net effect of pathological sterility would be the difference between the actual index and some base value that represents natural infecundity. The formula for measuring the index of sterility is represented as:\n\\[\nC_f~=\\:1\\:-\\:f\n\\]\nwhere f is defined as the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund."

    "text": "2.3 Background and institutional factors\nIn this study, we assessed the socio-economic or contextual characteristics that influence fertility through changes in the proximate determinants. These were the level of education, female participation in the workforce, wealth quintile, geopolitical regions and type of residence. Each of these factors has well established associations with fertility [21]. We examined fertility preferences through the ideal number of children and desire for more children. The DHS asks women with living children, “If you could go back to the time [when] you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” For women who are yet to give birth, the question is framed as “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019). We considered only numeric responses. The survey also asked women whether they wanted more children in addition to those they have, thus reflecting desire for further reproduction.\nThe study also tracked four indicators of women’s fertility preferences. The key indicators that reflect fertility-related international policy and program priorities include planning status for most recent birth in the past five years, percent of children born to mothers under age 18, percent of children born to mothers over age 34, and the median length of the birth interval (in months). We assessed the strength of Nigeria’s Family planning programs using the Family Planning Effort Index (FPEI) and National Composite Index on Family Planning (NCIFP). The FPE has been collected periodically since 1972, and provides results across four key components: policies, services, evaluation, and access [22]. The index was developed to measure the level of effort that goes into FP programs, and to track how these changes over time. The NCIPF measures the existence and implementation of family planning policies and program under five components: strategy, data, quality, equity, and accountability. It is built on the FPEIS framework [23]."

    "text": "2.4 Results\nThe indices of direct biological and behavioural determinants of fertility from Bongaarts models is shown in Table 1. The behavioural indices include index of sexual exposure (Cx), index of contraception (Cc)and index of abortion (Ca) while the index of sterility (Cs) is a biological determinant. Postpartum infecundability (Ci) is a function of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence. The duration of amenorrhea is a function of the normal length of amenorrhea after childbirth women which is due to breastfeeding practices. The duration of abstinence is entirely behavioural.\n\nTable 1: Estimated Indices for Proximate Determinants of Fertility, DHS 2003-2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nCx\nCi\nCa\nCf\nCu\nPF\nTFR (Survey)\nTFR (Bongaarts)\n\n\n2003\n0.70\n0.59\n0.94\n0.81\n0.85\n21.00\n5.65\n5.65\n\n\n2008\n0.70\n0.62\n0.94\n0.82\n0.82\n20.72\n5.72\n5.80\n\n\n2013\n0.72\n0.64\n0.94\n0.80\n0.81\n19.48\n5.50\n5.93\n\n\n2018\n0.68\n0.64\n0.94\n0.80\n0.82\n19.61\n5.29\n5.67\n\n\n\nCi was the lowest among the indices in our study at 0.64 in the 2018 survey. This implies that postpartum infecundability is associated with reduction of potential fertility by 36% from its biological maximum. Delayed sexual exposure (Cx) inhibited fertility by 32% being the second most effective ferility reducing factor. The index of abortion was high at 0.94. Hence, abortion [24–26]. This index is therefore excluded from the discussions. The other reductions in PF occurred because of inability to bear children (Cf, 0.80) and effects from the use of contraceptive technologies (Cu, 0.82). The lowest contributor is the index of contraception, contributing to 18% reduction in PF. There were little changes during the period of the survey in the 5 indices.\nThe revised Bongaart’s model gave an estimated TFR of 5.67, which is 0.38 children higher than TFR measured by DHS survey in 2018 (5.29). The analysis arrived at similar values for 2003 (5.65 each). Any difference between these sets of TFRs may be due to underestimation in DHS samples, inaccuracies in the data, inexactitude in our estimation of the indices, or other factors left out of the model. Nevertheless, the model shows the relative contributions of the determinants, and enables us report variations between socio-economic and geographic groups, as well as changes over the years of the surveys 2003-2018.\nThe influence of the proximate determinants and their variability by these background factors are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2003 respectively. The study shows that for 2018, attainment of secondary education is associated with relatively low indices for sexual exposure (0.58) and contraception (0.62). Across the educational attainment levels, these two indices have an inverse relationship in all years of the survey. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability increases with additional educational attainment. This would reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Concerning disparity in place of residence and wealth, Cx was higher among rural residents in all years (rural - 0.74, urban - 061). This means sexual exposure inhibited fertility by 33.5% among rural residents, and 39% among city dwellers. On the contrary, the Ci was higher among urban residents (rural - 0.61, urban - 0.68). Contribution of sterility to reducing PF is not dependent on place of residence, as Cf in all years were within ±0.03 units. As expected, the index of contraception is higher in rural areas relative to urban population, reflecting a higher contraceptive use among sexually exposed female urban dwellers. There also are notable differences between women of different wealth quintiles. The values of the indices are lower for women in higher wealth quintiles, meaning a higher depression of fertility, with exception of Ci. The Ci increases progressively along the wealth quintiles (lowest - 0.56, second - 0.61, middle - 0.64, fourth - 0.68, highest - 0.75) in 2018, as well as across all the years of the survey.\nWorkforce participation is associated with a lower fertility in 2018, with no notable difference in preceding years. In the latest year of the survey, the estimated TFR among women in workforce was 5.22, compared to 5.93 in women without workforce participation. In 2013 however, the reverse was the case (in workforce - 5.76, not in workforce - 5.62) The differences were negligible in 2008 (in workforce – 5.93, not in workforce - 5.99), and 2003 (in workforce - 5.78, not in workforce - 5.74). In all years, the index of contraception contributed more to depression of fertility among those in workforce compared to those not active in workforce. In contrast, the index of marriage and index of sterility contributed more to fertility reduction among women of reproductive age not active in workforce. The contributions of the index of postpartum infecundability and index of abortion were near identical.\nTable 2: Estimated indices of proximate determinants of fertility

study also attempts to examine the effects of inputs into Nigeria’s family planning program on fertility reduction. The family planning effort index (FEPI) score increased between 1972 and 1999, then reduced through 2009, before increasing to 41% in 2014. The increase in FEPI to its all-time highest in 1999 corresponds to the lowest survey TFR recorded in Nigeria, 5.11 in 1999 [27]. During this time, access to contraceptives was high at 70.3%, and evaluation of services rendered stood at 81.4% (see Supplementary Information). The FEPI has since been replaced by another measure, the National Composite Index on Family Planning, NCIFP (see Supplementary Information). The most recent NCIFP in 2017 assessed the strategy (score - 62.4%), data (65.5%), quality (62.0%), accountability (39.0%) and equity (58.0%) of family planning in Nigeria. On all measures, the scores in 2017 (composite index - 62.4%) were higher than those in 2014 (composite index - 49.5%).\n\n\n\nNigeria Family Planning Effort Scores - This indicator is based on the aggregate of four dimensions of family planning effort (policies, services, evaluation, and method access). The raw scores were converted to percentages and are reported\n\n\nLastly, the study includes some outcome indicators. The state of planning for new births and incidence of births among the young and aged population are a reflection of policy priorities concerning reproductive options available to women. [21]. Among 12.2% of women aged 15-49 years with at least one child, the most recent birth was planned i.e. they wanted to have their last child at the time. There has been no notable increase in the median birth interval. The percentage of births to women less than 18 years of age has steadily reduced from 8.9% in 2003 to 6.0% in 2018. Overall, after an initial increase between 2003 and 2008, the percentage of births to women older than 34 years has remained relatively unchanged.\nTable 6: Some Women Reproductive Options Outcomes Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome Indicator\nYear of Survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2003\n2008\n2013\n2018\n\n\nMost recent birth was planned\n16.7%\n11.9%\n9.8%\n12.2%\n\n\nMedian birth intervals (months)\n31.2\n31.3\n31.7\n30.9\n\n\nBirths to women &lt;18 year\n8.9%\n7.3%\n7.1%\n6.0%\n\n\nBirths to women &gt;34 years\n14.4%\n15.3%\n15.3%\n15.0%"

    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nThis study used the revised Bongaarts model to show contributions of biological and behavioural determinants of fertility in Nigeria, and the effects of selected socio-economic and geographical variables. Specifically, the results measured the effect of sexual exposure, use of contraception, post-partum infecundability, abortion and sterility on reducing a potential fertility level of 21 births per woman.\nCultural and socio-economic differentials in the TFR trend exist and mean the decline has been uneven with a larger family size more desired in the north than the south [28]. A study in Kaduna State reported less than 20% of women wanted less than 5 children and 69% citing 5-14 children as ideal [29]. This difference in fertility pattern can be attributed to early marriage prevalent in the Northern part of Nigeria [30,31]. In addition to the geographical disparity, there are considerable differences in rates among ethnic and socio-economic groups [32]. TFR rates are lower among women who live in urban areas, women who have a secondary school education, and women who belong to households in higher or highest wealth quintiles [14].\nOur results showed that postpartum infecundability remained the strongest influential factor in reducing fertility from 2003 to 2018 . These results are similar to previous studies in Nigeria [12,13].\nAnalysis on the effect of education, geographical location (residence and region), workforce cadre and wealth quintile showed that high income earning women who were more educated and resided in urban regions were least affected by postpartum infecundability in comparison with the rural, poor and less educated women. This may be correlated with shorter durations of breastfeeding probably due to the intense work schedules common in urban areas which in turn lead to reduced period of postpartum amenorrhea. This is similar to analysis on the World Fertility Survey and Demographic and Health Survey by Chola and Michelo [10].\nFindings from a study conducted among the major Nigerian ethnic groups - Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa [33] using the original Bongartz’s model, suggested that the main fertility-inhibiting variables among the Igbos were marriage [11] (due to delayed marriage evident in this region), contraception use, and post-partum infecundability due to post-partum amenorrhea [11]. This is similar to our results, as the region predominantly occupied by Igbos i.e. South-East had similar patterns from 2003-2018 – with delayed sexual exposure having the most fertility inhibiting effect probably due to the prevalent system of late marriage in this region.\nIn contrast, although in the afore-mentioned study, post-partum infecundability was the main fertility inhibiting variable among the Yoruba and Hausa ethnic groups, followed by the marriage index and contraceptive use - having an effect among Yorubas only [11]. The use of contraception, post-partum infecundablity and sexual exposure respectively reduced fertility effectively from 2013-2018 which maybe as a result of increased level of education and probable awareness of different contraception methods in this region [34] This suggests that the most effective proximate determinants vary with location and ethnic classification. Hence, attempts to make uniform policies for fertility reduction and other health-related issues should consider the differences in social and cultural background of Nigeria.\nThe results also showed that sexual exposure was the second most influential factor in reducing fertility especially in the Southern region of Nigeria. This could be attributed to the considerably high effectiveness of contraception among sexually exposed women in this region with about 77% of the contraceptives proven effective from 2003 to 2018 which coincides with findings from Dev et al., (2016). The most common modern methods included the male condoms (18.9%), implants (17.4%) and injectables (17.0%). This suggests that family planning methods targeted at sexually exposed women may have a huge impact on fertility reduction.\nThe proportion of births inhibited because of contraception is higher in 2003 (32%) when compared to what was seen in 2018 (30%). This difference in the inhibition of fertility could be explained by the differences in the number of sexually exposed women which was 70.2% in 2003 and 68.2% in 2018.\nIn our current study, sterility played the third role in reducing fertility. In 2003, it accounted for 19% in decreasing fertility and by 2018, it slightly increased to 20%.\nVariation in education levels, wealth quintile, being a member of the workforce, region and place of residence, among the study participants between the regions could have brought changes in awareness which in turn influenced the index of contraception as noted in our results. In this study, contraception use had a higher impact among women with higher education who lived in urban regions and belonged to the highest wealth quintile. This is because women who are in the afore- mentioned category tend to delay marriage and are more likely to use modern methods of contraception [35].\nContrary to most studies on fertility determinants in Sub-Saharan Africa [10]; [36]], measurement of abortion was possible in this study. Induced abortion had a limited effect in reducing fertility accounting for only 6% in fertility reduction from 2003-2018. This maybe because induced abortion is illegal in Nigeria except when performed to save a woman’s life [17]. In our study, the inhibitory effect was more evident in women who are highly educated, live in urban areas, belong to the workforce and live in urban areas probably due to increased educational attainment and access to certain facilities. The illegal status and the availability of induced abortion have highly influenced the impact of the abortion variable on fertility in Nigeria. The South-South rank second in the proportions of women using any contraceptive method (29%) [17] and any modern method (18%), it also has the second highest level of unmet need (18%) [17]. Compared with women in other regions, those in the South-South may be relying on abortion to a greater degree, and on contraception to a lesser degree, to achieve the smaller families they desire Hence, the high inhibitory effect of abortion noted in this region.\nThe most recent index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate that the program efforts have increased only slightly. The decline noted in the 2009 FEPI scores could be attributed to poor record of actual access to contraceptive methods for most of the population [37]. However, by 2014, the scores improved (see Supplementary Information). Three out of four components had high scores, with The Policies component improving the most [38]. These scores simply imply that Nigeria ought to gear much of her efforts on creating mechanisms at the national, subnational, and facility level to monitor access to voluntary, non-discriminatory Family Planning information and services. Additionally, ensure equity of services to all members of interested population [38].\nOur findings showed that the median birth interval remained fairly constant at less than 2 years (&gt; 34 months) from 2003 to 2018. This is against the recommended 3 to 5 year interval [ref]."

    "section": "2.6 Conclusion",
    "text": "2.6 Conclusion\nFrom our study, it was discovered that among the four proximate determinants of fertility, postpartum infecundability played an important role in influencing fertility. It had the highest fertility inhibiting effect accounting for about 34% fertility reduction. The index of sexual exposure in 2003, 2008 and 2013 played an important role in inhibiting fertility. Contraception use had a higher impact among women with higher education and wealth quintile.\nTherefore, the Federal Government of Nigeria and developing partners need to design effective strategies to increase contraceptive use across the country. State-specific policies needs to be developed to address fertility levels across Nigeria. Increasing access to family planning information, services, and methods is essential. Providing high quality family planning services, commodities to support those services, and communication and messaging around family planning all require financial resources. It is critical that enough funds are provided to support these efforts.\nThese approaches ought to be specific to the different geopolitical zones since There are varying behavioural and proximate determinants unique to these regions. The table below shows top three recommended strategies for each zone based on findings from our study.\nTable 7: Top three recommended strategies for fertility reduction in Nigeria’s geopolitical zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographical Region\nFirst Suggested Strategy\nSecond Suggested Strategy\nThird Suggested Strategy\n\n\nNorth-Central\nHeightened awareness and sponsorship on the use of Contraception\nAdvocacy for delayed sexual exposure through eradication of child marriage prevalent in this region\nEnhanced education on the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among women in rural regions\n\n\nNorth-East\nHeightened awareness and sponsorship on the use of Contraception\nAdvocacy for delayed sexual exposure through eradication of child marriage prevalent in this region\nEnhanced education on the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among women in rural regions\n\n\nNorth-West\nHeightened awareness and sponsorship on the use of Contraception\nAdvocacy for delayed sexual exposure through eradication of child marriage prevalent in this region\nEnhanced education on the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among women in rural regions\n\n\nSouth-East\nEnhanced education and promotion of the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among high income, educated women residing in urban regions.\nContinued sponsorship and promotion Contraception use\nPromotion of delayed Sexual exposure\n\n\nSouth-South\nEnhanced education and promotion of the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among high income, educated women residing in urban regions.\nPromotion of delayed Sexual exposure\nContinued sponsorship and promotion of the use of contraception\n\n\nSouth-West\nEnhanced education and promotion of the importance of breastfeeding as a family planning method especially among high income, educated women residing in urban regions.\nPromotion of delayed Sexual exposure\nContinued sponsorship and promotion of the use of contraception"
