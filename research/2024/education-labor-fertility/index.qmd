# Abstract

This research paper delves into the intricate interplay between education, labor, and fertility, unraveling nuanced relationships that shape family planning decisions using a multi-purpose survey conducted across major towns within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria. Through a comprehensive analysis, the study reveals key findings: the negative impact of dependent children on intended fertility, the mitigating role of income, the complex dynamics of longer work hours, and the gender-specific influences of childhood household size. These findings contribute to our understanding of demographic transitions, shedding light on evolving societal structures and influencing policy considerations*

**Key words**: fertility, demographic transitions, labor, education, multi-purpose survey
