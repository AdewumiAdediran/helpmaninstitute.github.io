## Abstract

In this study, we investigated the influence of Nigerian non-oil exports on its economic growth using quarterly data set (2016 Q1 to 2021 Q4) sourced from the NBS (2022). In contrast to existing empirical works, our study dis aggregated the non-oil exports into four sector categories namely manufactured, agriculture, solid mineral and raw material goods exports. By employing the ARDL model, the study finds that in the long-run, all the non-oil sector export considered in the study had a positive impact on Nigeria's GDP, though, these positive impacts were only found to be significant for row material goods export. The short-run estimates of all the sector export showed negative coefficients implying that the non-oil sector exports considered in the study are beneficent to the Nigerian economy only in the long-run. The study thus points out that more efforts are needed towards export goods from sectors such as manufactured, agriculture, and solid minerals so that their potential benefits can be fully felt in the economy, one way to accomplish this is to restructure Nigeria's export structure so that a broader mix of export destinations and value-added goods is available for export.
