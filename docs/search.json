    "text": "There is currently limited evidence, if any, to support the hysteria that emerged out of the first decade of the 21st century, of the prospective dividends of Africa’s growing population, and especially of the youth cohorts. The Africa rising meme has since mellowed as a result of weakening economic growth, due primarily to falling commodity prices, and softening growth prospects.\nEconomic growth in the continent fell from average of 5.4% in 2000-2010 to 3.3% in 2010-2015 compared to global growth of 3.0% and 2.9% during the corresponding periods. The downward trend continued as growth in the region dropped further to 2.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, as population growth slowed in the rest of the world, Africa has continued to experience population boom. Projections indicate that Africa will account for about 60% of global population growth between 2017 and 2050 and be the main contributor to global population thereafter.\nNigeria maintains an outsize influence on the African population and economic growth trajectory. As shown below, the decline in Africa’s economic growth from 3.9% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2016 reflects largely the decline in performance of the Nigeria economy from 5.5% growth in 2013 to 1.5% contraction in 2016. The influence is also noticeable in the projections through 2018 (Figure 1.1).\n\nWith population of 187 million in 2017, Nigeria is currently the 7th most populous country and home to the fastest growing population in the world (2.7% per annum during 2010-2015). As a result, while Africa is recognized to have the youngest population among the world regions, Nigeria’s population is even younger. Children under age 15 account for 44% of Nigeria’s population compared to 41% in Africa, while the share of youths aged 15-19 remains the same at 19%. While a youthful population portends opportunities for demographic dividends, young children create additional burden of economic dependency that constrains potential dividends.\nThe economic benefits of population are dependent primarily on labor markets than any other market. That is, whether a growing population of working age becomes a net benefit or net burden depends primarily on the vibrancy of industry and commerce, and whether the labor force possesses the skills and human capital requirements of the sector.\nIn the absence of social safety nets, more specifically unemployment benefit programs, self-employment and entrepreneurship becomes the viable option for labor force participants unable to secure paid employment in government and organized private sector. Thus, in the absence of productive and competitive education and skills, hard and soft infrastructure essential for channeling financial resources to prospective entrepreneurs, and a friendly entrepreneurship sector, a growing population is essentially a ticking time bomb.\nAlthough evidence shows that Nigeria is already within the demographic window of opportunity, a period during which population can yield substantial economic benefits if the conditions are right, there is no evidence that the country will generate positive demographic dividends under current conditions and the population and development experience.\nThe question on the minds of observers and analysts is how Nigeria can turn its growing population into a force for accelerated growth and development. Among other things, this will require changes in population structure and its geography, growth and productivity. The alternative is to maintain the status quo and look on as the population turns into an economic burden and breeding ground for social unrest, and ultimately a disaster."

    "text": "Company managers and national policy-makers have always considered productivity as central to growth and competitiveness. In the past, companies simply accumulated factor inputs (employed more land, labor and capital) and expanded operations. The trick for achieving growth is that additional input of a factor raises the partial (marginal) productivity of the other factors. Thus, abundant labor combined with natural resources including arable land, forests and underground deposits that could be sold to acquire the needed materials and machines, were the engines of growth. Economic competitiveness policies focused on comparative advantage in factors of production, and countries are encouraged to exploit the factors they have in abundance. However, models explaining economic change in late 20th century began to speculate the emergence of technological innovation and imitation as foremost drivers of growth and evolution of industrial structure. To be successful over a long period of time, it is simply not enough to employ more; firms and economies must develop the ability to innovate and employ new technologies derived from innovations.1 Rather than factor accumulation, economic growth was driven primarily by shifts or changes in production functions. Thus, economic competitiveness policies shifted emphasis from comparative advantage driven by factor endowments to deliberate pursuit of strategic competitive advantage driven by high value addition and economies of scale.\nIn the globalized world of the 21st century, innovation has become mandatory for survival, competitiveness and growth of individuals, firms, regions and countries. Anyone of these units is easily blown out of its respective competition once innovation slows or ceases, ranging from individuals competing in labor markets, firms competing in product markets, states or regions competing for investments, and countries competing in export markets. Competitiveness of these units in output markets determine their respective abilities to compete in the input markets, further elevating the centrality of innovation to market development and competition. In the social or nonmarket economy, innovation can make a difference in how a state manages diversity and prevents conflict, educates its population, provides access to safe drinking water, eradicates disease and reduces hunger. The value created by innovation manifests in new ways of doing things and emergence of new products and processes that contribute to increasing the level of society’s well-being. Innovation transforms inner capabilities of individuals, firms, societies and economies, and strengthens their capabilities to learn, adopt and exploit new ideas.\nThere are many definitions of innovation as are analysts of the subject. However, a more general definition that captures the main essence considers innovation as “the search for, and the discovery, experimentation, development, imitation, and adoption of new products, new production processes and new organizational set-ups.”2 Other definitions associate innovation with application of ideas, knowledge or practices that are new to particular contexts with the purpose of creating positive changes or seizing opportunities. Noticeably, the definitions stress the words “new”, “change” and “improve” in defining innovation. Thus, for any process, product or service to be considered as innovation, the novelty, useful changes and improvements should be noticeable, meaning, a large improvement or bits of changes that accumulate to produce a significant improvement.\nMore than anything else, the quantity and quality of innovation strongly depend on the depth of the “knowledge economy,” a term which describes the production and application of knowledge to create new processes, products and markets.3 The core of this economy comprises research universities and colleges, institutional and corporate research and development laboratories and programs that produce knowledge, as well as education and training systems that utilize new knowledge to produce more capable workforce, which in turn raises the quality of knowledge produced. This symbiotic core is bolstered by institutions and regulations that protect intellectual property rights and create strong incentives for knowledge production; information and communication technology and other infrastructure that facilitate exchange and reduce the cost of access to frontier knowledge and products; vibrant competitive markets for capital needed for entrepreneurship and commercialization of new knowledge; and a business sector that absorbs knowledge, grows in depth and sophistication, and provides feedback to the core. Together, these factors constitute the pillars of innovation input in the Global Innovation Index (GII)4, co-published annually by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Innovation output is measured by scientific publications and patents; medium and high-technology component of manufactures, technical component of exports and share of the creative industry in the economy.\nThe knowledge production and absorption system, funded and supported by private companies and governments, constitutes the core, central and indispensable pillar of the innovation economy. Outputs generated in this system are disseminated through books and articles in scientific journals, translated into patent applications and other scientifically codified products, and are absorbed into the education and workforce development systems that in effect create more knowledgeable workforce. However, an efficiently-managed well-developed statistical system that supports regular and extensive data collection is indispensable for the knowledge economy. Countries that invest in planning and data collection encourage and attract the best of knowledge development skills; they maintain higher quality and standard of education and better quality of human capital, produce more scientific outputs, and have greater success at innovation.\nThe second pillar of the innovation economy are the institutions that engender social stability, protect intellectual property rights and create strong incentives for investment and trade in innovation output. First, a system that insulates the knowledge economy from political instability is essential. University faculty strikes and industrial actions, in response to political stimulus, that affect research and training institutions constitute an albatross to development. In addition to institutional arrangements that encourage application for patents, a sound legal system that protects copyrights and guarantees individual rights to knowledge output, supported by regulations that are favorable to business startups, is essential for development of market and growth of innovations. Academic researchers, writers and composers are often afraid to share their original ideas with colleagues for comments and scientific scrutiny for fear of plagiarism, unapproved imitation and piracy due to lack of strong protection by the legal system. This apprehension limits the extent of collaborations and thus the quality of outputs. Research articles produced in such systems often end up in departmental journals that are not read outside of the department and similar journals that are not widely read and cited. In the end they become knowledge that society cannot use.\nA culture of experimentation and entrepreneurship is key to innovation. Meanwhile, capital is essential for transforming ideas into products particularly for innovators who are not endowed with family wealth or other forms of startup funding. While programs to stimulate entrepreneurial culture are essential, vibrant markets for entrepreneurship capital that are accessible to the young and talented are essential, particularly initiatives that do not require collaterals such as business plan competitions. Deepening the market for small business capital, startups and venture capital will also require credit and information systems that the financial services industry can build upon.\nA business economy that is based on educated, knowledgeable and high skill workforce, and provides regular feedbacks to the knowledge production and education sectors are essential to aligning the knowledge and business economies. This requires regular engagement and collaboration between industry, academia and policymakers.\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) and other infrastructure that facilitate knowledge codification and packaging, and reduce the cost of production and access to frontier knowledge and outputs constitute the next pillar of the innovation economy. Access to internet and mobile communications technology, efficient logistics in terms of transportation infrastructure, solar and electric energy infrastructure to power productive activities, all contribute to efficient production and exchange of goods and services derived from new ideas. Information systems are also crucial for reduction of asymmetry between actors in the innovation economy. Systems that enable the shifting of resources toward the most productive use of them are essential for efficiency. Students making decisions about what course of academic study to pursue require accurate and timely information about what kinds of jobs the economy is producing and where the jobs will be coming from by the time they complete their education, thus helping to avert mismatches between the skills being acquired and those needed, thus avoiding loss of economic value through creation of human capital that businesses cannot use.\nAmong the former British colonies that were endowed with initial potential, India offers a leading example of knowledge-driven development. At independence in 1947, the economy was dominantly agrarian with a population of 345 million that was the second largest in the world. By 1950, agriculture accounted for 60 percent of the economy while industry and services were 12 percent and 28 percent respectively, and the non-agricultural sector was dominantly informal.  However, the country’s economic development and transformation had been quicker than the developed world and more balanced than China’s, despite a larger share of microenterprises that minimized opportunities for economies of scale. Since 1965, India’s GDP growth rate has risen on a decadal basis and is currently among the highest in the world. By 2014, the share of agriculture declined to 14 percent as industry and services grew to 28 percent and 58 percent respectively. Often regarded as the largest democracy in the world, India was ranked by Forbes as the best emerging market in 2014, numbers among the current top destinations for medical tourism, and has 3 of its leading companies ranked among the top 100 innovative companies in 2015. These include a consumer good company ranked 41st, its largest information technology company ranked 64th and its largest pharmaceutical company ranked in the 71st position.\nThis performance is by no small measure driven by a strong knowledge economy which began to develop prior to independence. Growing out of a statistical laboratory that dates back to the 1920s, the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was founded in 1931 as “a learned society,” led by an Indian national, with the objective to carry out research, teaching, training and development projects in all sectors of the economy. The institute became integrated into the Indian statistical system, which had been in existence since 1862, through its pioneering engagement in agricultural experiments, large-scale surveys, statistical quality control and national development planning. After gaining independence in 1947, the government demonstrated its commitment to the knowledge economy through an Act of Parliament declaring the ISI as an Institute of National Importance in 1959 and granting the right to award degrees and diplomas in statistics. After satisfying the personnel requirements of the national, state and district statistics departments, trained statisticians spilled over into quality control and improvement jobs in industry, ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Due to this head-start over other developing regions in data and statistics, India became the foremost attraction to academic researchers from the developed world interested in less developed societies, and consequently, provided the primary context for the formative period of development economics research.\nAlthough the green revolution originated in Mexico in the 1940s, its adoption and greatest success around the world took place in India beginning in mid-1960s, aided by an existing system of experimentation and research that grew out of the ISI. Further technical advances in agriculture enabled a structural transition in which the share of agriculture in total employment declined commensurately with its share of value addition. The benefits for poverty reduction were evident. Although India is home to the largest number of poor people than any country in the world, estimated at 273 million in 2012, its poverty incidence dropped from 56.4 percent in 1973 to 21.9 percent  in 2012, a rate that was considered one of the lowest among countries with the largest number of poor people. The informal share of the economy dropped from 40 percent in 1950 to 20 percent in 20085.\nIn contrast, Nigeria offers example of a former British colony endowed with similar potential for knowledge-driven development but instead pursued a path of “dependent” development. At the time of independence in 1960, agriculture accounted for 64 percent of the Nigerian economy while industry and services were 10 percent and 26 percent respectively. By 2014, agriculture was down to 22 percent of the economy, with industry and services accounting for 25 percent and 53 percent respectively. However, the transition was anything but balanced; poverty rates increased from less than 30 percent in the 1970s to 69 percent in 2012 and is estimated, after methodological revisions, to be 33 percent in 2013; the informal share of the economy decreased from 63 percent in 1970 to 50 percent in 2008.\nEfforts to establish a statistical system began6 in 1928 when the British Colonial government established a statistics unit in the office of the Colonial Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat. In 1947, a statistics section was created in the Customs and Excise Department which was afterward transformed into a full-fledged Department of Statistics. The Department of Statistics was subsequently expanded to form the nucleus of a central national statistics office. The Statistics Act of 1957 provided for a decentralized statistical system and collaboration between the central and regional statistical offices. At independence in 1960, the Department was moved from Customs and Excise to the Federal Ministry of Economic Development and was renamed the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS). In the post-independence period, the statistical system was underfunded, under-appreciated and was not taken as a serious source of information essential for national development. Subsequent changes to the system including the shifting of responsibility for financial statistics to the Central Bank and demographic and health statistics to the Nigerian Population Commission, and the abolishing of the common statistical system in the 1980s and served to weaken the statistical system and render it irrelevant. In spite of reforms and restructuring leading to creation of the National Bureau of Statistics in 2007, the current statistical system remains weak and underfunded; most of the recent development surveys are funded from external sources, and regular surveys conducted by them have little depth and usefulness.\nThe lackluster attitude toward domestic statistical system and the knowledge creation it facilitates is a reflection of the culture of “knowledge dependence” that pervaded the mindset of government and policymakers. The idea, which dominated the African independence era of the 1960s and has had lingering effects thereafter, was that the stock of scientific knowledge required for economic progress existed in the developed countries and simply needed to be transmitted to the developing countries in order for them to develop.To be fair, this attitude was not deliberate, but was more essentially the outcome of two factors: a blind attachment to the prevailing paradigm and a mindset that believed in “free lunch!” On the first factor, African leaders bought wholesomely into the prevailing United Nations scientific agenda, which was driven by a “Good Samaritan” motive of facilitating application of science and technology in the less developed countries. The efforts began with the New York scientific conference on the conservation and utilization of resources in 1949, only 4 years after the creation of United Nations in 1945, and continued through the Geneva conference on the application of science and technology for the benefit of the less developed areas in 1963, as well as the Vienna conference on science and technology for development in 1979. On the second, African leaders tended to treat technology as manna from the developed world!. Instead of experimentation and research in agriculture, for example, it was believed that only extension agents were needed to persuade farmers to adopt better technologies that were available elsewhere. Thus, technical advancement in agriculture was pursued simply by expanding agricultural extension workforce. To this end, African countries hired additional 36,000 extension agents between 1959 and 1980.7 This attitude almost systematically neglected the importance of building-up of local capacity and ownership of productive and applicable knowledge.\nThe consequences of this neglect are dire at many levels. First, due to the symbiotic relationship between the education system on one hand, and research and experimentation system on the other hand, the quality of the former cannot be superior to the latter. Knowledge produced through research and development translates into capacity development through institutions of learning and intellectual development, and higher capacity reinforces the quality and outputs of research and development. The number of Nigerian universities increased from 5 in the immediate post-independence era in 1962, to 51 in 2005 and more rapidly to 129 in 2014 as a result of licensing of private universities.8 As at 2012,9 there were 37,504 academic staff in the public university system, and teaching staff to student ratio was on average 1:3310 but reached as high as 1:122 at the University of Abuja. Annual academic publications were 0.2 per capita, 83 percent of which were published in journals created by the teaching department of the author or in local journals that have no visibility, while the remainder appeared in international journals, majority of which are pay-to-publish outlets that rarely rank among those frequently consulted by policymakers and development partners. Public and university-level research grants are rare, and when are available, they are paltry sums that barely cover basic research costs. Over the years, the neglect of data and research has weakened the quality of university graduates. Research projects typically required for undergraduate degrees are increasingly written by online consultants and academic supervisors (in exchange for fees) or copied verbatim from existing research. Employers of labor increasingly require graduates to sit for qualifying examinations and, increasingly, are forced to retrain new recruits in order to bring them to the level of knowledge they ought to have attained in the university. Companies that find those efforts costly simply refuse to hire new graduates; most advertisements for jobs that fresh graduates were hired to do in the past now emphasizing years of work experience, leaving most graduates unemployable. The global ranking of top universities and colleges reflects this condition. While an Indian educational institution was ranked in the 251-300 range, the foremost and premier Nigerian university barely made it into list of the top 800 universities and colleges in 2015, ranking the in the 601-800 position.\nData from the Global Competitiveness Index (GII) presented in Table 1 also provides empirical support to the divergence in knowledge-driven development between the two countries. In assessing competitiveness of the education and training system, India was ranked in 45th position out of 144 countries on “quality of education system”, a sharp distinction from Nigeria’s rank of 122nd on the same index. Knowledge produced elsewhere is valuable only to the extent of available capacity to comprehend, adapt and apply them sensibly in the domestic context. While the research and experimentation system that had been well developed in India prior to the green revolution enabled understanding, adaptation and application of the high-yielding varieties that emerged, Nigeria and other African countries missed the opportunity to benefit from the movement due principally to lack of requisite capacity. India and Nigeria are wide apart in terms of the culture of research and experimentation, and consequently the culture of innovation, whether measured by company spending on R&D (India 30; Nigeria 106), availability of scientists and engineers (India 45; Nigeria 89), or university-industry collaborative R&D (India 50; Nigeria 123). On all these counts, India consistently ranked among the top 50 countries while Nigeria consistently ranked in the bottom half (below average) among the 144 countries.\nThe quality of knowledge systems affects not only the education system, but also the efficiency of health and economy-wide production systems and labor markets, thus affecting the capacity of the economy to attract and retain talents. On the basis of capacity to retain talents, India ranked 42nd while Nigeria ranked in 92nd position in the GCI. This is even so despite the more competitive ranking of the Nigerian labor market on account of freedom to hire and fire (Nigeria 7; India 47) and more minimal effect of taxation on labor supply (Nigeria 21; India 45). While both countries are large in population and provide large markets for entrepreneurs, the more competitive aspects of the Nigerian labor market do not seem enough for talent retention in the absence of a strong health system, high quality education system, vibrant enterprise capital market and a sound legal system for businesses, to mention a few. The positions of India and Nigeria are also distinct in terms of governance and institutions that support the knowledge economy. India ranks in the top 50 on account of judicial independence, efficiency of legal system, and efficiency of government spending. On the same indices, Nigeria’s position was clearly near the bottom, and in particular, ranked as one of the most wasteful spenders around the world (134/144). India is well positioned among the most developed enterprise capital market in the world, ranking in the top 30 in both venture capital market development and access to business loans. Again, Nigeria ranked in the bottom 30 on those indices. The divergent rankings in business sophistication also signal differences in the strategies pursued by the two countries. While India is evidently achieving competitive advantage through value chain deepening and business cluster development, Nigeria seems to remain firmly in the comparative advantage regime.\nGlobal Competitiveness Index 2014-2015FactorIndicatorsIndiaNigeriaAggregate Index71127Higher education and trainingQuality of the education system45122InnovationCompany spending on R&D30106Availability of scientists and engineers4589University-industry collaboration R&D50123Labor market efficiencyCapacity to retain talent4292Effect of taxation on incentive to work4521Hiring and firing practices477InstitutionsJudicial independence50102Wastefulness of government spending49134Efficiency of legal framework43105Financial Market DevelopmentAvailability of venture capital20131Ease of access to loans29137Business sophisticationBusiness cluster development2772Value chain breadth4392Competitive advantage44117\nIn spite of the lagging performance of Nigeria in this context, opportunity exists for catching up. However, Nigeria will not move to the frontier by simply importing technology. Neither will it catch up by simply harping on science and technology, a pattern that has a history of its own. What is required is to reverse the neglect through a set of well-targeted reforms, policies and programs that are focused on the knowledge economy.\nThe starting point is a wake-up call to the university system. An inspection of the mission statements of prominent Nigerian universities shows the centrality of innovation, high quality education, and needs of society to their existence. This is captured with statement such as “expand the frontiers of knowledge … produce graduates who are worthy in character and sound judgment … contribute to the transformation of society through creativity and innovation” (University of Ibadan);  “research and development, innovation, knowledge transfer and human resource development, … responsive to the needs of the society” (University of Nigeria, Nsukka); “new ideas and intellectual practices relevant to the needs of its immediate community, … advance the frontiers of learning, …. through teaching, research and the dissemination of knowledge of the highest quality.., to produce high-level human power and enhance capacity-building..” (Ahmadu Bello University Zaria); “application of modern technology to teaching, research and community service, and its provision of practical solutions to social, cultural and economic problems, … advancement of knowledge and its practical application to social, cultural, economic, scientific and technological problems” (Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife). However, the wake-up call will fall on deaf ears unless three critical challenges confronting the university system are taken seriously and addressed with a sense of urgency that they deserve. These are governance, standards and funding in decreasing order of importance and degree of urgency. Reversing or altering the order amounts to placing the cart before the horse!\nGovernance is the most important challenge. As the primary foundation of the knowledge economy, the university system requires self-regulation that is only sustainable through self-governance and stability that is realizable through insulation of the university system from the political system. The starting point in this regard is for the federal and state governments to abolish the practice of meddling in appointment of principal officers of the universities, including vice chancellors and members of university governing councils. Although theoretically possible, it is difficult in practice, for a vice chancellor appointed on the basis of political patronage to resist appointment, promotion, enrolment of students and discharge of oversight duties on the same basis. While the distortionary effects of political patronage on incentive systems are generally non-trivial; the perverse incentive effects are most pronounced and most destructive in knowledge creation environments. In recognition of this sensitivity, the right to self-governance of universities is considered a fundamental right. This recognition is reflected in Section C, Articles 11 and 12 of the Kampala Declaration on Intellectual Freedom and Social Responsibilities (1990) of the International Human Rights Conventions and Declarations, which state:\n“Institutions of higher education shall be autonomous of the State or any other public authority in conducting their affairs, including the administration, and setting up their academic, teaching research and other related programmes. The autonomy of institutions of higher education shall be exercised by democratic means of self-government, involving active participation of all members of the respective academic community.”\nThe current practice where professors lobby (some practically prostrate themselves to the ground for) politicians and ministers for appointment to the position of vice chancellor is shameful, and is both inconsistent and incongruent with the natural pride of the university system in its professional independence, progression by merit and advancement through creativity. In progressive countries, appointment of the chief executive of a university begins with the search committee and ends with the governing council, not “the Minister of Education in consultation with the National Universities Commission.” The argument perennially put forward in support of the current practice is “he who pays the piper dictates the tune,” that is, if government funds an educational institution, it should have a say in who heads it, a code phrase for political patronage! Of course, this will only be heard in countries where governments simply think about giving education to its population in order to reduce illiteracy rate or fertility rate (typical among Africans!). It will never be heard in countries where the university system is regarded as foremost to creativity, innovation and international competitiveness (ask South Koreans!).\nOnce self-governance is settled, the next challenge is establishing and enforcing strong academic standards in terms of who gets in, the quality of instruction they receive and the quality of research produced in the universities. These are the most important issues that keep the leaders of world leading universities awake at night. It is not every secondary school graduate that should be admitted into universities; it is the top ranking ones who should make it there. Currently, an average or bottom-ranking secondary school graduate can make it there if his/her parent is connected or knows somebody who is connected to a principal officer of a university. All that is required is for the applicant’s name to show up on the JAMB/UTME list of applicants by whatever means. If the students would not ordinarily make it to the list, the parents could buy a slot in it, or if that is difficult, they could enroll the ward in an examination center where cheating is not corruption! Some universities have made post-UTME exam mandatory in order to weed out such kids from getting in, but there are many challenges to the algorithms. The private universities are there to admit kids rejected by the public universities once the parents can afford their fees. So, the kids who should not be in the university are there, Pronto! The second area where standard is essential is the quality of instruction and mentoring offered at the universities. The most important concern of governance of leading universities is summed up in the question “what do we make of these smart kids?” The university system works like any other production system that transforms input into output. Academic and teaching staff that are not close to the frontier of knowledge cannot produce graduates that are ready for the world of work.\nNigerian universities are full of several kinds of characters. Some characters do not show up in class until few weeks to end of semester; a phenomenon that started in early 1990s when economic conditions became hard-hitting and full-time lecturers worked effectively as part-time instructors in their position, and continues today. There are some who simply dictate lecture notes they wrote 10 to 15 years prior when they were undergraduates taking the classes they are now teaching. Some classes have no textbooks, students are only required to read the lecturer’s handout. Some recommended and required textbooks are 20 years or more behind the frontier of global knowledge. When it comes to examinations, the best students are those who can repeat verbatim what the lecturer said or dictated in class, or wrote in the handout, word-for-word, definition-for-definition, illustration-for-illustration. The university system has a very weak or no mechanism at all that allows students to evaluate their instructors, neither does it have a system that regulates the standard of publications required for academic staff progression. Departments and programs in good universities around the world have standard lists of reputable, ranked journals, a list of which is provided to all academic staff, where publications would be regarded as meeting a particular standard, along with numbers expected to be published in specified categories in order to be promoted. The practice in Nigerian universities to simply count the number of publications creates perverse incentives that have severely limited scholarship. The falling standard of education in Nigeria is well acknowledged by parents and employers. However, it is not the result of any form of genetic mutation in the population, where invasion of the country by “less smart” aliens during the last 20 years is perhaps leading to reduction in the proportion of smart kids in the population. The fault lines are in the quality of intakes and the quality of instruction.\nOnce self-governance and standards issues are resolved, the university systems is now set for its original mission of generating innovation, producing high quality graduates, and addressing the development challenges of society. Resources from government and industry in the form of research, conference and professional development grants are needed to spur innovation. Institutions that fund research, experimentation and surveys such as National Science Foundation and National Institutes for Research and Experimentation should be established, alongside efforts to develop the capacity of National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to undertake regular large-scale surveys. An Act of parliament that declares these institutions as “Institutions of National Importance” may be helpful, but essentially they must create the mechanism to fund the institutions through regular statutory allocations from the government. This challenge must not be left for the Federal Government alone to tackle, States must do the same. From historical experience, government takes the lead in funding research and development while industry takes the back seat. Once a threshold of capacity for innovation is attained, the private sector typically moves to the front seat afterward.\nOnce the core of the innovation economy is strong and productive, the remaining pillars typically begin to develop and build on the foundation. Enterprise finance markets that provide capital for young entrepreneurs,11 and venture capital markets are more likely to be deepened as capacity for innovation improves. The business economy transforms gradually and so does the technological structure of the economy.  And the process continues. As the popular Pizza Hut advertisement goes, people and resources “gather around the good stuff!”"

    "title": "Medical Tourism, Demographic and Nigeria’s Health System",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Medical tourism refers to cross-border movement of people to receive medical, dental or surgical care, driven by affordability, accessibility or better quality of care than is available in the home country or region. It represents a growing market that connects the healthcare, tourism and hospitality industries.\nThe global medical tourism market is estimated at US$38.5-55.0billion based on estimated 11 million cross-border patients and per capita expenditure of US$3500-5000 per visit in 2014. The industry is estimated to grow at 15-25% per annum, faster than any individual economy around the world. The growth of the industry is driven by advances in information-communications technology, decreasing cost of international travels, changes in transnational disease patterns, and asymmetries healthcare industry developments around the world.\nAlthough the industry had existed since ancient times, when ancient Greeks and Egyptians went in search of health-enhancing hot springs and baths, its growth became noticeable in the 18th and 19th centuries when middle-class Europeans and Americans flocked to health spas and sanitariums even in remote places in the hope of finding treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis, gout, bronchitis or liver diseases.\nIn the 20th century, medical tourism was driven prominently by wealthy people traveling from developing countries in search of advanced healthcare in developed countries. However, the 21st century emerging pattern involves travels from more developed countries to less developed countries and within regions in search of affordable treatments.\nMedical tourism is driven by a combination of push and pull factors. Patients in advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada where universal health coverage (or socialized medicine) results in long waiting times for treatment often seek treatment in countries where they would not have to wait; high costs of healthcare in the United States induce patients to seek treatment in countries such as Mexico and India where prices are affordable; immigrants travel back to their home countries to receive care in health systems they are familiar with; expatriates return to countries in which they once lived and arrange care in facilities offering what they regard as high-quality, comparatively low-cost and consumer-oriented treatment; patients in need of medical interventions not approved in home countries (for example stem cell injections of unknown therapeutic effect and risk) travel to countries including China, India and Ukraine where such restrictions are less binding; and others travel overseas for procedures that are illegal in their home countries (for example commercial kidney transplant) to destinations where they are not challenged by laws.\nThe top specialties for medical travelers are cosmetic surgery, dentistry (general, restorative and cosmetic), cardiovascular surgeries (angioplasty, CABG, transplants), orthopedics (joint and spine; sports medicine), cancer treatments (often high-acuity or last resort), reproductive health (fertility, IVF, women’s health), weight loss surgeries (LAP-BAND, gastric bypass) and scans, tests, health screenings and second opinions.\nCurrent top global destinations for medical tourism are Costa Rica, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. In the African region, South Africa and Tunisia are listed as the leading earners from medical tourism. Tourists are attraction to these destinations primarily by advances in healthcare and reputation for clinical excellence, political transparency and commitment to international standards, and the state of tourism infrastructure. Being the primary source of attraction, advances in healthcare are driven by innovations, clinical quality assurance, and improvements in health infrastructure. Both government and private sector investments are critical to these advances.\nDemographics play an overwhelming role in growth and development of medical tourism from both supply and demand sides. The population of top medical tourism destinations are dominated by early-to-mid adults; population age (median years) range between 27 in India and 40 in South Korea.[i] In addition, the top specialties for medical tourism are associated with health consumption of mid-to-late adults.\nCountries with young populations are less likely to have the resources and pressure to develop the kind of health system that is required for the industry; infectious diseases are prominent and are the central emphasis of the health system and health investments in those countries. Similarly, countries with aging populations are less likely to find the space and resources to undertake the essential investments; they are saddled with chronic and degenerative diseases that require the most expensive types of treatment and prolonged care which constitute substantial drains on public investments in needed infrastructure.\nCountries in intermediate but advanced stages of the demographic transition are endowed with dominantly middle-age adult population and have the greatest potentials for medical care exports. While health needs and demands of the population generates the pressure needed to innovate and develop healthcare services at home, their consumption of those services creates the incentives for further innovation and development-focused investments. If the conditions are right, a country with such endowment could generate substantial life cycle savings driven by labor income that could fund substantial investments in infrastructure, while taxation income could support research and innovation. Demographics also play an important role in shaping governance and private sector development. Demand for democratic governance and pressure on governance systems for transparency are significantly strengthened by an energetic adult population. Private sector development is driven by entrepreneurship and innovation that are associated mostly with vibrant early-to-mid adult population.\nIt is estimated that 30,000 Nigerians travel abroad every year for medical care and spend about $1billion in the process, and about a quarter of the sum was spent in India in 2012. Realization of the potential benefits to the economy if such expenditures are retained locally has prompted several reactions including calls for restriction of government sponsorship of public officials and channeling of more resources toward the health sector. The private sector health alliance has recently launched a new initiatives to address management capacity gaps in the health sector in order to stem the tide of these imports. While these initiatives are helpful, it is unclear that they can make substantial impacts on the health system in the absence of a coordinated effort to take a wholesome look at the health sector.\nNigeria is a young country with median population age of 18.2 years. Communicable diseases accounted for 66 percent of deaths in 2014 with non-communicable diseases and injuries making up 24 percent and 10 percent respectively. Thus the epidemiological profile is dominantly infectious, and efforts and resources are currently devoted to prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, among which malaria is predominant. However health service needs will shift toward treatment of non-communicable diseases as the country progresses through the demographic transition. Getting the health system ready to respond to the needs of the changing demographics requires different types of investment. The potential for Nigeria to become a medical tourism earner and reduce import of medical services depends on coordination of efforts to meet the healthcare needs emerging along the demographic transition.\nDeliberate efforts, programs and policies that galvanize both private and public sector resources are needed to create a ready system. While health system infrastructure strengthening, upgrade and development are essential, research, innovations and clinical quality assurance are critical for advancement of the health system and development of medical tourism. Central to these outcomes is a culture of knowledge development through data collection, management, analysis and interpretation, and engagement of decision makers at various levels of the healthcare system, through both operational and policy levels, to use the knowledge and discoveries in making needed changes and implementing proffered solution to existing challenges. The quality of human resources for health depends on the depth of this culture; it is difficult to imagine a system of health training that is more sophisticated than the depth of knowledge generated through its healthcare system.\nNigeria is currently not positioned for medical service export neither can it restrict its import, owing to unfavorable demographics, weak infrastructure, lack of innovation and a poor culture of knowledge development and management. However, demographic conditions would change in near future and present opportunities to develop the export market. The question is whether the health system will be prepared!\n[i] Median age in years for the remaining countries are Costa Rica (30.0), Israel (29.9), Malaysia (27.7), Mexico (27.3), Singapore (33.8), Taiwan (39.2), Thailand (36.2), Turkey (29.6) and the United States (37.8)."

    "text": "2.1 Introduction and Purpose\nUnderstanding the epidemiological profile of a territory is necessary to evaluate and address public health needs. Reliable and appropriate health metrics aid policy development, proper health management, evidence-based decision-making, rational resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation of health services and policy. Population health data is becoming an effective and increasingly utilized tool in efforts to treat widespread health problems. Health data has also played an important role in the design and implementation of community-wide health initiatives implemented to promote good health practices. While the demand for health information is increasing in terms of quantity and quality, the response to these needs has been hampered because of fragmentation and major gaps and weaknesses in national health information systems. Insufficient track of epidemiological events has long plagued Sokoto State. Information is poor on progress, success or consequent failure of programs and interventions. As a result, proper health planning and interventions have been stalled affecting the general health welfare of the Sokoto population. In order to fill this breach, accurate and enough informant should be collated and made easily assessible to the general public further enhancing health planning. Failure to this will not only result in public health issues but affect the economic growth of Sokoto state. The present effort is a modest attempt to describe the epidemiological profile of Sokoto from the past and contemporary perspective. This profile will also aid in evaluating the successes achieved as well as caution against the daunting challenges awaiting the state. Variation in the population age structure, altered lifestyles of population attest to the demographic, development and health transition occurring in the state. Population stabilization, life-style modification, surveillance and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases constitute the major challenges demanding urgent attention in the future. The main objective of this project to construct an epidemiological profile, which would serve as a tool to monitor progress of the health of Sokoto, enable efficient program planning and management. Furthermore, this will provide the information needed by health policy and decision-makers. The public health issues facing the states are presented in the following sections: communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, injuries and accidents and other important health information. Each section focuses on analyzing past as well as current situations, providing policymakers with evidence and forecasts for planning."

    "text": "2.2 Data Sources\nPrimarily, the main sources of the data presented in the report are from the WHO and UN agency databases which in turn, rely on surveys as their primary sources: Demographic and health surveys (DHS), Multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS), Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS) and Standardized monitoring and assessment of relief and transitions (SMART) surveys. Information on indicators that are not collected in routine surveys was obtained from modelled estimates available from public sources (such as, the National Bureau of Statistics), status reports, and reviews, journal publications. Health data on Sokoto state are difficult to assess and often unavailable. When unavailable, assumptions were made based on recommended standards.\nMajor causes of mortality in Sokoto State (2016) was estimated to assess disease impact to the population. To obtain a proper representation of various mortality factors and their corresponding effects, it became pertinent to describe Sokoto’s mortality profile with a proportional mortality; a ratio of individual mortality cause to the total mortality, showing the percentage each disease contributed. [1]. Sokoto’s proportional mortaility was computed based on data from the Sokoto State Health Strategic plan (HHSP-II) of 2016 [2] . In addition, some assumptions were made based on experts’ opinion and WHO standards for missing data. Death from several diseases were then expressed as a ratio of the total death in Sokoto. The proportions were represented as percentages. An Excel template was created to capture prevalence and incidence data for indicators discussed."

    "text": "2.3 State Context\nSokoto State is located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria, and subdivided into 23 local government areas (LGAs). The State covers a land area of approximately 27,825 square kilometers, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills has its topography dominated by a rolling peneplain [3,4]. The state experiences its rainy season from June to October, with cold and dry north eastern winds known as the “Harmattan” occurring frequently from December through March [5] . The economic activity in Sokoto is agriculture, in addition to exploitation of natural resources. More than 90% of the population engaged in subsistence farming [5] . The state is one of the fish producing areas of the country, thus, many people along the river basins engage in fishing activities. Large-scale farming is practiced in the State using irrigation water. There are all kinds of animals both wild and domestic in the State. Sokoto ranks second in livestock production in the country with animal population of well over 8 million. Minerals such as Kaolin, Gypsum limestone, laterite, Red mills, Phosphate, both yellow and green shade clay, sand etc. are available in the State in commercial quantities. The availability of these economic potentials provides good investment opportunities, particularly in agro-allied industries such as flour mills, tomato processing, sugar refining, textiles, glue, tanning, fish canning and dairy.\nThe Sokoto State Ministry of Health (SMOH), like other Nigerian states, has overall responsibility for the health sector. The State Ministry of Health is responsible for advising government on policy formulation, regulation and implementation of health and health related issues in the state. Organization of the health delivery system in Sokoto State conforms to a three-tiered system: tertiary, secondary and primary level care. The people of the state are majorly Muslims and Islam provides them with code of conduct that influences their day-to-day activities, such as the emphasis on cleanliness in all aspects of life. Hence, in Sokoto state, there are strict injunctions regarding private and public hygiene derived from their Islamic law, which if applied will improve overall well-being of dwellers [6]."

    "section": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases",
    "text": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\nDiseases Communicable diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens that people spread to one another through contact with contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, blood products, insect bites, or through the air [14]. Most common forms of spread include fecal-oral, food, sexual intercourse, insect bites, contact with contaminated fomites, droplets, or skin contact. Some of the leading communicable disease in Nigeria include HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, malaria, meningitis, diarrheal diseases, syphilis and lower respiratory tract infections [15]. Regarding CDs in general, the interplay of agent, host and environment factors lead to a dynamic state of health and disease. New or emerging illnesses are often caused by organisms already in the environment and which become infectious due to altered conditions in the ecology[9]. This occurrence could be as a result of poor hygiene and unsafe sanitation (e.g. open defecation by adult and unhygienic disposal of children feces-a prevalent practice), poor utilization of health personnel for maternal health care (In 2011, 87.7% pregnant women aged 15-49 years used their homes for delivery whilst 11.7% and 0.6% visited public and private health facilities) which are major risk factors especially in rural communities in Sokoto State [16].\nCommunicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto state [8]. Sokoto state has long been plagued by communicable diseases notably: malaria, leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhea, whooping cough, HIV and meningitis as far back as the nineties tetanus [8]. Based on the proportional mortality that was estimated (2016), CDs along with maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions in Sokoto State accounted for an estimated 73% of all deaths - a high figure especially in contrast with developed countries (deaths due to communicable diseases in the United States of America was 5% only in 2016) [17]. Common communicable diseases plaguing Sokoto state are discussed below:\n\n4.1.1 HIV/AIDS\nThe first case of AIDS was reported in Nigeria in 1986. The current national prevalence of HIV is estimated at 1.4% (15-49 years), with a total estimated 1.9 million persons living with HIV in Nigeria [18]. Prevalence among females is significantly higher at an estimated 1.9%, with male prevalence estimated at 0.9% [18]. In 2014, about 136,833 people were living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Sokoto out of a projected population of about 5 million [19].\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto has fluctuated substantially over the years. The first HIV Sentinel Survey in 1991 showed a prevalence of 1.8% [20]. Subsequent sentinel surveys produced prevalence of 1.6% (1993), 2.7% (1999), 2.8% (2001), 4.5% (2003), 3.2% (2005), 6.0% (2008) and 3.3% (2010) [19]. Based on the recent National Aids Indicator Survey (2018), HIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto state is estimated to have reduced to 0.4% (15-49) years in 2018; making them one of the low prevalence states in Nigeria with a disease burden of 12,844 approximately 0.013% of the burden in low prevalence states [18].\n\n\n\nFigure 3. HIV Prevalence Trends in Sokoto state (1991-2018). Source: Nigeria ANC Surveillance Report 2010; National Aids Indicator Survey, 2019.\n\n\nNew infections are primarily from key populations , especially female sex workers and their partners in the general population [18]. The HIV prevalence in the urban areas is lower than the rural areas in Sokoto State. In these rural towns and villages, risk is driven by variations in sexual behaviors such as casual, transactional and sex work; with female sex workers ranking high as the source of new infections Beyond behavioral risk factors, environmental and systemic factors also constitute risks for HIV infection. Transfusion of infected blood and blood products and poor handling and disposal of highly infectious wastes generated in healthcare settings increase the risk for HIV transmission [18].\nIn addition, other structural drivers play a role in the HIV epidemic in Sokoto. These include those socio-cultural factors that increase people’s vulnerability to HIV infection such as: poverty, gender inequality-inability of women to demand condom use due to male dominance over women’s reproductive rights, extra-marital sex and/or multiple sex partners, female genital mutilation and levirate marriage (Widow Inheritance), disempowering women from seeking HIV prevention or treatment services without the permission of their husbands/partners, human rights violations and the persistence of HIV and AIDS- related stigma and discrimination [18].\nMortality due to AIDS in Sokoto have considerably reduced over the years. This decreased by 14% from 2016-2018. As at 2016, AIDS death contributes to 2 percent only of the total mortality rates in Sokoto State. [2]. This accomplishment might as well be credited to successful intervention programs.\n\n\n4.1.2 Tuberculosis\nSeveral infectious diseases once considered to be controlled have re-emerged to become major public health problems of a greater magnitude than was previously the case; tuberculosis is one of such. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium spp. There are two types of human tuberculosis: Pulmonary and Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. A study conducted to determine the species of Mycobacterium involved in cases of human tuberculosis in Sokoto State indicated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (69.23%) has remained the major causative organism causing tuberculosis in Sokoto, followed by Mycobacterium bovis (20.51%) and finally the atypical mycobacterium (10.26%) [21].\nIn 2006, a total of 1,383 of all forms of cases were registered out of which 92% (1,265) tested sputum smear positive [22]. However, this increased to 3,329 in 2013 with 67% (2,170) testing sputum smear positive. The rate of relapse remained fluctuating from 2009-2013. Nevertheless, the number of failed treatment cases reduced by 1% (2008-2013) [23]. Individuals within the age group of 25-34 years had the highest infection rate while those within the age group of 0-14 years had the least infection. Overall, males were affected more than females probably as a result of high exposure. The number of Direct Observed Treatment Short course centers (DOTS) increased progressively from 2008 to 2013 which improved treatment access to TB patients. Hence, DOTS can be credited to be one of factors resulting to a reduction in the total number of cases rate [23].\nNigeria has a high degree of overlap between HIV and TB infected population among 15-49 years age group. The recorded HIV prevalence among TB patients has risen from 2.2% in 1991 to 19.1% in 2001 and an estimated 27% in 2003 [24]. The TB/HIV co-infection rate of 27%, suggests that about 800,000 persons have both HIV and TB infection. At this rate, an additional burden of 50,000 TB cases annually is added from the HIV infected people [25]. Prevalence rates of HIV, HBsAg and HCV among TB patients vary from region to region in Nigeria. In 2016, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was 5.6% (2.2% female and 3.3% male) in Sokoto State. The female to male ratio of TB patients was 1:2.9, while the ratio of co-infection of HIV among TB patients for female to male was 1:1.5 [26]. Co-infection occurred in age range of 21-40 years only, with age group 31 – 40 years having the highest prevalence of co-infection [26]. This high prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was observed in younger sexually active age group. In 2018, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients increased to 16.3%. Prevalence of HBsAg and HCV among TB patients was 14.9% and 5.4% respectively [27]. In addition, prevalence of co-infection of HIV-HBsAg-HCV in TB patients was 1.45% in 2018 [27]. The causes of HIV-HBV-HCV co-infection has been associated with parenteral, sexual and vertical transmission, and sharing of injections by injection drug users.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Leprosy is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities [28]. Cases of leprosy are usually classified as either paucibacillary leprosy (PB) or multibacillary leprosy (MB). This classification is based on counting the number of skin lesions and is primarily used for the purposes of chemotherapy, as PB cases are treated for 6 months and MB cases for 12 months using different regimens [29].\nBefore 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy endemic countries in the world. Surveys in the 1940s and 1950s found prevalence rates ranging from 16-390 per 10,000. In 1991, country wide leprosy prevalence rate of 30.3 per 10,000 was estimated [30]. Although Nigeria achieved the targeted prevalence level for the elimination of leprosy before the year 2000 and attained low endemicity to a large extent, incidences have still being noted since then [30].\nLeprosy cases in Sokoto dropped by approximately 76% from 2006 to 2013 (with a total registered case of 263 in 2006 and 63 in 2013) [23]. This can be attributed to the success of the Multi-drug therapy introduced to Nigeria in 1985 and launched with the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program (NTBLCP) in 1991 together with the discharge of inactive or wrongly diagnosed patients, adoption of the WHO 12-month MB treatment regimen and massive discharge of all patients on the former 24-month regimen that had received more than 12 doses [30].\nIn 2009, 225 leprosy cases registered, 62% (139) were males including children and adults whilst 38% were females (86). This however declined to 86 registered cases in 2013; 73% males and 27% females . Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age. In 2009 about 7.5% of children were affected by leprosy among all the registered cases [31], which increased to 19% of children in 2011 [32] but declined slightly to 15% of children in the year 2013-indicating a high level of leprosy transmission [23]. The pre-dominant type of leprosy in Sokoto state is the MB while lesser cases of leprosy is the PB. MB proportion increased progressively from 91% in 2009 to all forms of leprosy cases falling into the MB classification by 2013, implying longer treatment regimens for patients as well as increased risk of transmission since MB is commonly classified as the infectious leprosy [30].\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Trend of Registered Leprosy cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Tuberculosis and Control Program, 2009-2013.\n\n\nThe WHO disability leprosy grading system has been in use for years. Its main application has been used as an indicator for early case detection/reporting [33]. This grading system varies from 0 to 2; with 2 being the most severe. The rate of WHO Grade 2 disability decreased significantly from 19% to 9% during a one-year interval from 2011-2012. This falling disability rate indicates that new cases were increasingly diagnosed before they developed visible deformities. Thus, representing an improved promptness in case detection. Crude death rate due to leprosy has being fluctuating from 4.7 per 100,000 in 2010, 3.1 per 100, 000 in 2011 and 5.5 per 100,000 in 2012. This variation in the number of deaths may be indicative of an unstable treatment regimen. Efforts ought to be put in place to ensure this is effective [23,31,32].\n\n\n4.1.4 Malaria\nMalaria accounts for 40% of public health expenditure. 30 - 50% of in-patient admissions and up to 50% of out-patient visits in areas with high malaria transmission [34]. Malaria is endemic throughout Nigeria with seasonal variation in different geographic zones of the country. More than 90% of the total population is at risk of malaria and at least 50% of the population suffers from at least one episode of malaria each year [35]. Malaria has long plagued Sokoto State like other Nigerian states. However, there have been improvements over the years. This may be as a result of three major control interventions: insecticide treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) [36].\nGender-specific infection rate in Sokoto showed that males had the higher infection rate than females. There are no scientific facts to explain this phenomenon, however, suggestions have been made that this high prevalence rate could just be by chance, or due to the fact that males engage in activities which make them more prone to infective mosquito bites in comparison to their female counterparts, that are mostly at home and protected from such infective bites [35]. The age group 0 - 5 years had the highest infection rate followed by 6 - 10 and 11 - 15 years age groups [35]. Among children aged 6-59 months with malaria parasites, the dominant species of malaria parasites is Plasmodium falciparum specie (&gt;90%) with P. malaria playing a minor role [37].\nMalaria prevalence among children under 5 was measured in the 2015 National Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) and 66% of the children tested positive for malaria when RDTs were used to detect the presence of parasites while 46.6% tested positive when microscopy was used. The prevalence is higher with RDTs than with microscopy as expected because false positive test results are possible with RDTs [37]. This have been proven true by other studies, which have shown a higher prevalence of malaria using RDTs instead of microscopy [38,39].\nThe percentage of children with malaria is much higher in rural than in urban areas [37] as a result of poor environmental sanitation, which provides adequate breeding sites for the malaria parasite. Malaria prevalence decreases as the mother’s education level and wealth quintile status increase; which could be as a result of knowledge of preventive measures to malaria infection and access to cleaner as well as safer environs [37].\nUse of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is one of the most effective measures used to prevent malaria. Between May 2009 and November 2013, the government of Nigeria, with support from several partners, distributed approximately 52 million mosquito nets across the country. Overall in Sokoto (2015), 79% of households had at least one mosquito net, 77% had at least one ITN, and 77% percent had at least one LLIN. By 2018, 84% of households having at least one mosquito net, an average number of two ITNs per household and 39% having at least one net for every two persons in the household. [7]. Rural households are more likely to own at least one ITN than urban households [11].\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Malaria cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Bureau Statistics, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Malaria Deaths in Sokoto State (2006-2016). Source: WHO Global Malaria Program Estimates, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Diarrhea\nEach year, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea occur among children under five years of age, and estimates suggest that overall incidence has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, more than half of these cases are in Africa and South Asia, where bouts of diarrhea are more likely to result in death or other severe outcome . Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children in Nigeria; responsible for about 16% of child’s death every year. Nigeria was estimated to have a total number of annual child deaths due to diarrhea to be 151,700 [40].\nRotavirus has been identified among the most important cause of infantile diarrhea especially in developing countries. Reports have shown that 39% of diarrhea episodes seen at health centers were rotavirus positive . In 2015, the prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea accounted for 25.5% of diarrhea cases among children younger than five years of age presented to hospitals in Sokoto metropolis [41]. In Sokoto, diarrhea is most common among children age 12–23 months and least common among those age 48-59 months. Diarrhea with blood was also most common in children aged 12-23 months. Children of mothers with no education were twice as likely as children of mothers with more than a secondary education to have had diarrhea [42].\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Diarrhea prevalence in children under five 2008-2013. Source: NDHS, 2013\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Schistosomiasis\nAbout 252 million individuals might be affected worldwide with the disease [43]. Globally, the disease is on the increase in both prevalence and incidence because of the expansion of irrigated agriculture which provides habitats for vector snails; construction of hydro-electricity generating sites; lack of good sanitary habits; and lack of safe water for the growing population [44]. In Nigeria, three species are pathogenic to man: S. haematobium, S. mansoni and S. intercalatum [45].\nBoth intestinal and urinogenital schistosomiasis occur in Nigeria. Previous research has documented prevalence rates between 14.2% and 91.4% [46,47]. Schistosomiasis is typically more prevalent in children than adults. In a study, findings revealed that males within the age group 10-14 years recorded highest prevalence than females. Perhaps, as a result of frequent water contact by males in cercariae infested areas around the river [48].\nIn 2016, the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis (children) in Sokoto state was 60.80% and 2.93% for intestinal schistosomiasis. The prevalence of the infection by water contact activities showed that children who were involved in farming and children who swim and fish had the highest and second-highest rates respectively. Likewise, those who contact river and dam water for bathing, fetching and washing had similar pattern [45]. Children whose source of drinking water were dams, ponds and rivers had the highest prevalence in contrast with children that drink water from wells and boreholes- with the least prevalence.\nPrevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis is low, which may be because intestinal schistosomiasis is transmitted by Biomphalaria sps. of snails, whose presence is very low-slung in northern Nigerian regions. In contrast, high prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis may be attributed to high occurrence of vector snails of Bulinus sps. in the local water bodies of northern Nigeria [49] and high dependence on untreated water from natural water (especially amongst rural dwellers) where infection may set in, since schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and frequent contact of the population with fresh water may lead to high infection rates and constant re-infection [45].\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Schistosomiasis prevalence in children Source: Kabiru et al., 2013.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Polio\nNigeria is a major reservoir of poliovirus in the world and until recently the only country with ongoing transmission of all three serotypes namely: wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3), and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Nigeria is one of the three remaining endemic countries. As at 2005, Nigeria was responsible for about half of the global burden of polio [50].\nEnvironmental surveillance has repeatedly detected cVDPVs in Sokoto since mid-2013. An Environmental sampling conducted during 2014 detected 16 cVDPV2 in Sokoto [51]. The last reported case of poliomyelitis due to wild poliovirus type 2 was reported in 1999 and wild poliovirus type 2 was officially certified as eradicated in September 2015 [52]. In Sokoto State, four genetically related viruses were isolated from four environmental samples collected between 24 April and 9 May 2018; no associated case of acute flaccid paralysis has been detected, as the virus was isolated only from environmental samples. In October 2016, an unrelated circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreak and subsequently Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) events occurred in Sokoto State [53].\nNigeria mounted a massive vaccine response with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine (mOPV2) and Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), even surpassing outbreak guidelines. However, Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) has persisted in Sokoto [54]. This indicates that there is a high number of unimmunized children which threaten to sustain transmission. Improving the quality and oversight of the Sokoto program is an urgent priority to head off a resurgence of Type 2 disease nation-wide, particularly as immunity levels drop following the withdrawal of Trivalent oral polio vaccine and continued weak routine immunization [54]. However, the polio eradication program over the years have proven somewhat successful. 21st August 2019 marks three years since Nigeria last reported a case of wild poliovirus. This is an important public health milestone for the country and the entire Africa Region, with a step closer to being certified as polio-free [53].\n\n\n4.1.8 Meningitis\nCerebrospinal meningitis is a major public health problem still affecting tropical countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It is highly contagious and mortality from the disease remains high, despite major achievements in the treatment modalities. Outbreaks of Neisseria Meningitides (Nm) type C has been on the increase since 2013 in Sokoto state in Northwest, Nigeria. Eight hundred and fifty-six (856) cases were reported in Sokoto state in 2013 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 6.8%. The 2015 figure gives an alarming 5-fold rise in the number of cases seen compared to that of 2014. This implies it could get worse in subsequent years if no public health measures are put in place to stop the trend [55]."

    "text": "4.2 Maternal & Reproductive Health\n\n4.2.1 Maternal Health\nThree-quarters of all maternal deaths occur during delivery and immediate post-partum period. The single most critical intervention for safe motherhood is to ensure a competent health worker with mid-wifery skill is present at every birth [56]. A world fit for children goal is to ensure that women have ready and available access to skilled attendance at delivery. The indicators include the proportion of births with a skilled attendant and proportion of institutional deliveries. About 7.4% of births occurring in 2011 (Sokoto) were delivered by skilled personnel (2.5% Doctor, 4.9% Nurses and Mid-Wife). This increased to 20.6% in 2017 (7.7% doctors, 12.9% Nurses and Mid-Wives) [56].\nIncreasing the proportion of births that are delivered in health facilities is an important factor in reducing the health risks to both the mother and the baby. Proper medical attention and hygienic conditions during delivery can reduce the risks of complications and infections that can cause morbidity and mortality to either the mother or the baby. A large percentage of pregnant women in Sokoto deliver in their respective homes- 92.6% in 2011. However, a decrease to 87.7% was noted in 2017, with the rest delivery occurring in health facilities (Public and Private Facilities) [56].\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Causes of Maternal Deaths Sokoto - 2016. Source: Sokoto State Health Development Plan-II, 2016\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Vesico-vaginal Fistula\nVesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) is a devastating and debilitating condition which profoundly hampers the quality of life of women. Despite improvement in health care delivery systems and advancement in surgical techniques, VVF continues to be a major health problem [57]. Predisposing factors to obstetric fistula include early age at delivery, home delivery, early marriage, obstructed labor, unskilled birth attendant, economic and socio-cultural factors among others.\nProlonged obstructed labor is the main cause of obstetric fistula in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive at 96.5% [58]. It is a preventable and treatable disease commonly found among the poor population- young women and illiterate girls, who mainly live in the rural communities with difficulty in accessing emergency obstetric care and areas with limited or under-utilized skilled birth attendants [58]. Most of the vesicovaginal fistula patients in northern Nigeria had early marriages: 93.6% of Sokoto patients were married before or at 18 years of age [59]."

    "text": "4.3 Nutritional Deficiencies\nNutrition plays an essential component in the evaluation of a child’s growth and health. Children’s physical development is an important indicator of a society’s welfare. It reflects socioeconomic, food safety and environmental conditions [60]. The living conditions (i.e., socioeconomic, nutritional and environmental) to which children are exposed, influences their optimal growth potential [61]. Child malnutrition indicators are typically classified into: Acute Malnutrition, Underweight, Stunting and Overweight.\n\n4.3.1 Acute malnutrition (AM)\nAcute Malnutrition7 in children (6-59 months) is either moderate or severe. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)8 is an important indicator and the most dangerous form of malnutrition and closely linked to mortality risk [62]. A child with SAM has 9-fold increased risk of death compared to a child with no acute malnutrition [63]. Sokoto state had 9.8% Global Acute Malnutrition9 (GAM) and 1.0% Severe Acute Malnutrition coefficient in 2018, compared to its GAM of 10.5% and SAM of 2.4% in 2015, a slight change [62]. The estimates show a poor nutrition situation according to WHO classification of GAM rate of 5-9.9%. Sokoto has the fourth highest state prevalence in GAM and SAM of 8.4% and 2.0% respectively, evincing reflecting a poor nutritional status of the state. In 2015, Sokoto was above the warning threshold for GAM (10 &lt; GAM &lt;15) and WHO SAM crisis threshold of 2 percent [62].\nThe causes of malnutrition and food insecurity are multifaceted and include poor infant and young child feeding practices, which contribute to high rates of illness and poor nutrition among children under 2 years; lack of access to healthcare, water, and sanitation; armed conflict, particularly in the north; irregular rainfall; high unemployment; and poverty. Although chronic and seasonal food insecurity occurs throughout the country and is exacerbated by volatile and rising food prices, the impact of conflict and other shocks has resulted in acute levels of food insecurity.

    "section": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases",
    "text": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally, and one of the major health challenges of the 21st century. In 2016, they were responsible for 71% (41 million) of the 57 million deaths which occurred globally [64]. Non-communicable diseases are characterized as that which is non-infectious and of chronic nature. These include diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, neuro-degenerative disorders and injuries [65]. In the current global health context, ‘NCDs’ mainly refer to four diseases – diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory disease [65]. Nigeria is currently witnessing both demographic and epidemiologic transitions, which could be some of the possible reasons why the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing [66].\nIn Nigeria, research by WHO in 2016 shows that NCDs were estimated to account for 29% of all deaths (Cardiovascular diseases 11%, cancer 4%, diabetes 1%) [17]. Similar to the national pattern, NCDs less cancer was estimated to account for 21% of all deaths in Sokoto (Cardio vascular diseases 10%, Diabetes 2%) [2]. Though communicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto, the state is currently facing an increase in the burden of NCDs. The costs on society will therefore be staggering; the burden on the health system will be increasingly unsustainable, the loss from the workforce of adults in their prime will have profound effects on the fiscus and families, and communities will struggle to make ends meet. All these of course, is likely to be made worse by a rising population [67].\nThe focus of the health sector in most countries had been almost exclusively on healthcare services. However, because NCD risk factors lie in sectors beyond health, the key strategy to curb this rise is to use a multisectoral approach. Different sectors have different contributions to make towards solving this problem. Inability to curb this will lead to a bigger challenge future wise. Currently, NCDs contribute to 88% of all deaths in the USA (2016) -a huge burden yet to be tackled [17]\n\n4.4.1 Diabetes\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) was previously considered to be rare in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the prevalence is on the increase mainly because of urbanization and changes in lifestyle [68]. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide, and it is projected that by the year 2030 over 500 million adults will be affected by DM [69]. These large increases are predicted to occur mostly in developing countries and in adults especially between 45 and 64 years of age due to changes in lifestyles especially diet and physical inactivity [70]. These predictions indicate a growing burden of diabetes, particularly in developing countries. In 2011, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was about 2.7% in Nigeria [71].\nThe prevalence rate of 4.3% for DM in Sokoto was noted in 2017 amongst sub-urban dwellers [68]. The prevalence was slightly higher in men than women (4.5% vs. 4.0%) and differed significantly according to weight status or Body Mass Index classification. Prevalence of DM is still lower in rural (0.8%) than urban. This low prevalence of DM among rural dwellers could be attributed to the complementary traditional lifestyle, which depends on animal husbandry and subsistence economy [72]. The prevalence of DM increases with advancing age, a finding that is consistent with previous studies .\nWith respect to other blood sugar disorders, there was a relatively high prevalence of prediabetes defined as Impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) or Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) among a rural Fulani community in Wamakko Local Government area of Sokoto state [73]. The prevalence rates of IGT and IFG were 8 and 6.9% respectively This relatively high prevalence of IGT is similar to International Diabetes Federation estimates of about 8% prevalence rate for IGT in Nigeria [73] In urbanized Fulani, prevalence of 14.6% of IGT was recorded [74]. This is attributable to lifestyle changes associated with urbanization. Urban lifestyle in Africa is characterized by changes in dietary habits involving an increase in the consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, and reduction in fiber intake [75]. Urbanization tends to decrease physical activity as very little physical activity is required for daily living whereas rural populations rely on foot walk as transportation means and often have intense agricultural activities as their main occupation [72].\n\n\n4.4.2 Cancer\nCancer is a public health problem worldwide affecting all ages. It is the second commonest cause of death in developed countries and among the three leading causes of death in developing countries. WHO reported that about 24.6 million people live with cancer world-wide. There are 12.5% of all deaths attributable to cancer and if the trend continues, it is estimated that by 2020, 16 million new cases will be diagnosed per annum out of which 70% will be in the developing countries [76]. Cancer is an emerging non-communicable disease in sub-Sahara Africa. The pattern of cancer distribution in developed and sub-Saharan Africa vary significantly. While lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and urinary bladder carry more than 50% of cancer burden in Europe and America; the Sub-Saharan African region showed that breast, cervical, prostate, Lymphomas, gastrointestinal cancers carry more than 60% of cancer burden [77].\nAmong males in Sokoto state, the five most frequently reported cancers are bladder cancer (19.3%), prostate (9.9%) and non- hodgkin’s lymphoma (6.5%). The most frequent sites of cancers in females by rank order are breast (25.3%), followed by cervix uteri (14.1%) and ovary (5.6%). Almost half of the breast cancers were diagnosed in premenopausal women (in the 30-49 years age group), while cervical cancer tended to affect women a decade later. Significantly, bladder cancer did not appear to be frequent in females [78].\n\n\n4.4.3 Cardiovascular Diseases\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries and they are emerging as prominent public health problems in developing countries.\nThe prevalence of CVD in Sokoto (2009) was 52.60% in males and 47.40% in females [79] . The highest incidence of CVD was seen between the age ranges of 40-49 years while the lowest incidence was seen between the age ranges of 19 years. Hypertension, closely followed by stroke, is the most prevalent CVD while Chronic Heart Disease (CHD) is the least prevalent CVD in Sokoto Prevalence of hypertension (2017) was 23.6%. There is an age-related increase in the prevalence of hypertension. This is not surprising as blood pressure tends to rise with age and hence the possibility of a greater burden of hypertension as people live longer. The potential impact is the additional stretching of health resources, which is already failing the stress utilization test [80].\nCigarette smoking of any amount, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), diabetes mellitus, and advancing age have been identified as the major and independent risk factors for Chronic Heart Diseases (CHD). In 2017, the prevalence of dyslipidemia, total cholesterol and cigarette smoking in Sokoto was 3.5%, 6% and 7% respectively. These values are low possibly reflecting the low level of cholesterol in diet of most the people and nature of our occupation such as farming and transport system that force resident to engage in physical activity most at times strenuous [80]. Hypertension had the highest occurrence of mortality of all the CVD’s 30.85% while congenital heart disease had the lowest number of deaths 0.56% [79].\n\n\n4.4.4 Obesity\nObesity is a non-communicable medical disorder that has largely been accepted as reflection of healthy living and affluence among Nigerians. It is usually defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m 2 and is assuming an epidemic dimension [19].\nIn 2014, the prevalence rate of generalized obesity was 13.9% of which 1.7% had BMI&gt;40 kg/m 230.6% (11.4% in men and 19.2% in women), which was lower than the national prevalence rate observed in 2008 [66]. The higher rate of obesity in females may be related to their sedentary lifestyle in this part of country as many are full house wives, while males are more involved in physical activities arising from their farming occupations [80].\n\n\n4.4.5 Drug Use In Sokoto State\nIn 2017, prevalence of any drug use in Nigeria was estimated at 14.4% or 14.3 million people aged between 15 and 64 years. The extent of drug use in Nigeria is comparatively high when compared with the 2016 global annual prevalence of any drug use of 5.6% among the adult population . People who inject drugs constitute a sizeable proportion of high-risk drug users in Nigeria. The most common drugs injected in the past year were pharmaceutical opioids, followed by cocaine and heroin. While overall, more men were injecting drugs, women were more likely than men to report injecting heroin. The extent of risky injecting practices and sexual behaviors among the high-risk drug users and those who inject drugs is also of concern as is the extent of self-reported HIV among this group. Women who injected drugs were more likely than men to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors further compounding their risk for acquiring HIV among other infections [16]\n\n\n\nFigure 12.

The use of cannabis and non-medical use of opioids (tramadol, codeine, morphine) and cough syrups (containing codeine or dextromethorphan) are also the most common in this zone [16]. A qualitative study was conducted to examine the abuse of cough syrup as a new trend in drug abuse among the youth in five (5) Northwestern States of Nigeria. The results show that 33% claimed to source the substances from chemists and pharmacies, 36% claimed to acquire the substance from Drug dealers (retail), while 23% claimed they obtained the substance from Drug dealers (Wholesale) [81]."

This is more so in the developing countries like Nigeria where increasing industrialization, high velocity vehicles, increasing ethno-religious clashes and recently widespread terrorist attacks have resulted in sudden, unexpected mass casualties presenting to secondary and/or tertiary health centers [82].\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Mortality and Morbidity rates of RTA (2010-2013). Source: National Bureau of Statistics, 2014\n\n\nThe number of deaths as a result of road traffic accidents increased by 6.2% (2010-2013) with a simultaneous increase to 2.2% injured persons within the same time interval [83]. This could be as a result of flouting traffic rules and regulations, poor use of seat belts by motorists, outright refusal to use seat belts and an influx of alternatives to vehicles such as motorcycles and tricycles. Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALWs) enable and extend violence which has enormous public health consequences too. Within a ten-year interval of 2003-2013, Sokoto state had a prevalence of 0.07% SALWs, with 14% fatality, and peak age range of 26–35 years being affected. The most common types of injuries were wounds, systemic organ injuries and fractures. Brain trauma, though not very common had 75% mortality while systemic organ injury had 24.6% mortality [84]."

We incorporated the term “Nigeria”, and the names of all 36 Nigerian States, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), into the search strategy to retrieve studies conducted in Nigeria. There were no search restrictions placed on study intervention, comparator, or outcomes. However, appropriate filters were applied to limit the search results to human studies published in English. The search strategy for peer-reviewed publications can be found in Appendix 1. Search results were imported into Covidence (Covidence Systematic Review Software) for study-screening and selection."

Studies assessing the effect of LARCs on non-pregnancy-related outcomes were excluded. For instance, we screened out papers investigating the impact of LARCs on electrolyte levels. We excluded studies without methods, such as case reports and case series, abstract-only publications, commentaries, and narrative reviews.\nTwo independent reviewers (CO and BN) screened titles and abstracts for eligibility, then reviewed full texts for inclusion. Voting conflicts were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (EA). The selection of articles was done in two phases. The initial phase involved a title and abstract screening of final search results after removal of duplicates. The second phase was a full-text assessment of papers retrieved after the initial screening to identify studies that met the eligibility criteria."

    "section": "3.2 Knowledge and awareness on LARC methods",
    "text": "3.2 Knowledge and awareness on LARC methods\nThe knowledge of LARCs is relatively low. In 2003, only 27 percent of Nigerian women had heard of IUDs, 57 percent of Injectables and 10 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004) . Nonetheless, by 2018, 46 percent of women had heard of IUDs, 82 percent of Injectables and 70 percent of Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019). Awareness of LARCs varied with geographical location, wealth quintile and education levels. Women living in rural, and less literate North East and North West zones were least likely to be informed on any method of long-acting contraception. In contrast, women residing in urban Southern regions, (especially South West) were well-educated on the different LARCs available to them. Expectedly, low levels of education and household income led to reduced knowledge and awareness of LARCs in recentrounds of NDHS(National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Knowledge of LARCs by method. Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey\n\n\nWomen obtained information on LARCs from various sources. Primarily, such information were from friends and family (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Ameh and Sule 2007; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Secondary sources included the media, workshops and seminars, and health workers (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Monjok et al. 2010; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olukoya 1991; Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005). This indicates the importance of ensuring that non-medical personnel have access to the right information on LARCs since most women are more likely to get their foremost information from informal sources. Second, it suggests that organizing community-directed outreaches centred on raising awareness and providing information on LARCs to community members may yield notable results since women are more inclined to learn about LARCs primarily from their immediate community (Olukoya 1991). Female students, however, sourced their information on LARCs primarily from social media and lectures (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). This may probably be due to the academic environment. The positive effect of this observation lies in the potential of increased awareness through seminar, workshops and social media adverts (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Female students who had previous induced abortion were significantly more knowledgeable about LARCs (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012). Their experience of an induced abortion may have triggered the quest to obtain information on more effective and reliable ways of preventing unplanned pregnancies. Parents often feel uncomfortable communicating issues bothering sex or in some cases, lack adequate information on LARCs. As a result, young females are more reluctant to get information on LARCs from them (Orji, Adegbenro, and Olalekan 2005).\nStudies had contrasting views on the influence of religion on the knowledge of LARCs. Some studies reported the effect of religious beliefs on the knowledge, awareness and subsequent use of LARCs. (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Olaleye et al. 2014; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Christian women were reportedly more aware of LARCs than women belonging to other religions in Nigeria. This relationship may be confounded by the higher proportion of Christians in Southern Nigeria, where contraceptive prevalence is higher. (A. S. Adeyemi, Adekanle, and Komolafe 2008; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; Ugboaja et al. 2011). In contrast, two studies conducted by Aduloju et al. (2021), and Orji and Onwudiegwu (2002) concluded religion did not have any meaningful effect on awareness of LARCs.\nThe gap between the Knowledge of LARCs and its actual usage is wide (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002). This suggests that awareness alone does not determine the utilization of LARCs by Nigerian women. The common reasons for this gap include lack of knowledge on provider centers, distance from the source of LARCs, adequate information on the benefits of LARCs, fear of possible side effects, fear of the procedure, husband disapproval, religion and culture (Aduloju et al. 2021; Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001). Nigerian women often have misconceptions on the benefits and side effects of long-acting reversible contraception (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, there is the need to heighten awareness, to enable women make informed decisions while choosing a LARC method. Data from several rounds of NDHS suggests women who used injectables and IUDs were more informed on the side effects of these methods, what to do if they experienced side effects and other methods of long-acting contraception available to them than women who opted for Implants (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). In the same surveys, LARC users were least likely to receive information about side effects or safety issues from a private medical facility than from a government hospital. The same was true of information on what to do if they experienced side effects."

    "text": "3.3 LARCs utilization prevalence and associated factors\nAlthough still under-utilized, the practice of Long-acting reversible contraception by Nigerian women have generally improved between 2003 and 2018 National Population Commission, and ORC Macro (2004); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2009); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2014); National Population Commission, and ICF International (2019); Onwuhafua et al. (2005)]. The CPR of LARCs increased steadily from 2.7 percent in 2003 to 7.4 percent in 2018 among married women using contraceptives. Nationally, about 14.8 percent of women currently using any method of contraception used LARCs. The prevalence LARCs was highest among women aged 35 years and above and lowest among those aged 15-24. Injectables and IUDs were the most frequently used LARC (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; BC Ozumba and Ibekwe 2001; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). The most common reasons for using any method of long-acting reversible contraception were safety, reversibility, effectiveness, long-term protection, convenience, husband’s approval, understanding of the LARC method, personal choice, the desire to have good maternal health, satisfaction with information given on insertion procedure and services rendered by the healthcare provider recommendation by another woman who had used the method, affordability, approval by religion and duration of the desired LARC (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; The RESPOND Project 2013).\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Utilization of LARCs by method. Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey\n\n\nUse of LARCs varied with residence, region, level of education, number of living children, and economic status of the household. Married women residing in urban areas were more likely to use LARCs than their rural counterparts (National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019; Onwuhafua et al. 2005). The South-West zone had the highest proportion of women using LARCs, followed by the South-South zone . The lowest proportion of married women using any LARC method were in the North-East LARC use increased with educational attainment across all geopolitical zones. By wealth quintile, women in the lowest quintile were least likely to use long-acting reversible contraception and women in the highest quintile were most likely to use them. The limited use of LARCs in rural areas persists for various reasons ranging from unavailability of the LARC methods to lack of proﬁciency in administering LARCs by rural care providers (Onwuhafua et al. 2005).\nUse of LARCs was relatively low among singles compared to married women (Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Olaleye et al. 2014; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). This may be because single women are less likely to source for contraception openly because of cultural and religious prohibition of premarital sex in Nigeria (Ijarotimi et al. 2015). The uptake of LARCs increased with parity; women do not begin to use LARCs until they have had at least one child (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015; Konje et al. 1998; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002). An attribute pointing to the reproductive need of women with less than 3 children and the popular consideration of LARC methods as an alternative to the sterilization method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ijarotimi et al. 2015). Due to poor information on the use of LARCs, many healthcare providers were found reluctant to offer intrauterine contraceptive devices to women who have never had a live birth (Harper et al. 2008; Black et al. 2013). It is very crucial that misconceptions about LARCs are dispelled based on current evidence to increase the uptake especially among Nigerian women.\nWomen from poor households (lowest and second wealth quintiles) subscribed less to the different LARC methods compared to women from middle and wealthy households (middle, fourth and highest wealth quintiles) (Bolarinwa and Olagunju 2020; Ijarotimi et al. 2015; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Women aged 25 years and above were more likely to use a LARC method compared to women aged 15–24 years. Additionally, women who had 1–4 children subscribed further to LARC methods as opposed to women with no children.\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Percent distribution of long-acting reversible contraception use by state in 2018\n\n\nDepo Provera® and Noristerat® were the most commonly used brands of Injectables (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Depo Provera® was largely used by women in the South-East and North-West zones, while Noristerat® was primarily used by women in the North-East. Notably, Depo Provera was the brand of choice for women in the lowest, second and fourth wealth quintile, who had either secondary, primary or no education. Conversely, the use of Noristerat® increased with educational attainment and wealth status. Over time, the use of Implants, particularly Implanon® and Jadelle® became popular (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; Tunau et al. 2019). It seems that Implants have slowly replaced IUDs which were commonly used earlier. Highly educated women preferred Implants and had higher odds of using them the less educated counterparts. The plausible motive for this preference maybe the increased capacity to manage information correctly by educated women and awareness of the associated advantages of using Implants education provides (Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020). Non-literate women appeared to be suspicious of new methods and therefore shunned the method (Mutihir and Duru 2008). Specifically, young Nigerian women with desire for future fertility formed significant proportion of Implanon® acceptors (Roberts et al. 2015). Copper T, Depo Provera®, Noristerat® and Implanon® were the most popular brands of LARCs among female students (Olusegun, Ololade, and Ireti 2012).\nIUDs are least commonly used in Northern Nigeria. Religious constraints seem to be the major propeller behind this; Muslim women while not considering family planning as un-Islamic, often view the insertion of an external object into their body to be sacrilegious (Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984). Although still used in other regions in Nigeria, IUDs are gradually losing favor in the South-Western region (Ameh and Sule 2007; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). The need for their husband’s consent maybe one of the primary reasons for the general decline in the application of IUDs. The thread from the IUDs often give women away when using them without their husband’s consent (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). Married women were more likely to use IUDs than singles, as most singles opt for other forms of contraception (E. C. Ezugwu et al. 2020).\nAlthough some women were not current users, they indicated interest in using Injectables and IUDs in the future (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). The proportion of Nigerian women who were non-users, but intend to use a modern method of contraception (such as LARCs) in the future was lowest in the North-East. This was the same for uneducated women living in rural areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Knowledge of this is crucial in order to meet the rising demand for LARCs by Nigerian women. These statistics confirm that demand generation will be a critical component of meeting the national contraceptive prevalence goal (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014).\nThe acceptance and use of LARCs was largely dependent on the attitude of women (Aduloju et al. 2021). Women’s attitude (positive or negative) towards LARCs was primarily determined by their level of education and number of surviving children (especially sons). Improvement in health, maintenance of a smaller family size and the fact that it made life more comfortable steered a positive attitude in women which made them four times more likely to use LARCs (Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015). Some women frowned at LARCs because they viewed regulating their fertility as an unhealthy immoral behavior which is an affront to the God-given blessing of fertility (Renne 1997; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ukaegbu 1977). Another contributing factor to the attitude of the women to LARCs was the viewpoint of health workers. For instance, although family planning and health workers may promote the use of LARCs like IUDs, some do so with reservations, advising women not to use IUDs if they have not had children before (Renne 1997)."

    "text": "3.4 Sources, availability, and accessibility of LARCs\nNigerian women seek long-acting reversible contraception from both public and private sectors (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). Government hospitals, government health centers and family planning clinics were major public health outlets for LARCs. LARCs such as IUDs, Implants, and Injectables were primarily sourced from the public sector because they require trained service delivery While family/private hospital/clinics and private pharmacies, popularly called “chemist shops” were popular private sector outlets (Ayangade 1984; Egede et al. 2015 ; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004; National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014, 2019). The ease of accessing LARCs, proximity of service providers and level of confidentiality offered by service providers were key considerations in choosing where to get LARCs, given that some women used LARCs without their husband’s knowledge or approval (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013). Patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops being the most proximate and accessible providers were the major sources of LARCs that do not require trained medical services.\nReligion and denomination also influenced the source of purchase. Reported that while Roman Catholics purchase LARCs chiefly from patent medicine shops, the majority of other Christians procure theirs from general hospitals (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005). The patronage of patent medicine shops by Catholics maybe associated with a religious objection to the use of modern contraceptive methods and the desire to keep their purchase of LARCs “confidential.” Similarly, Muslims patronized patent medicine shops more frequently, also due to reported high disapproval by of contraceptives (Egede et al. 2015; Onwujekwe et al. 2013; Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005).\n\n\n\nPercent distribution of users of LARC methods age 15-49 by source.\nData from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018SourcesIntrauterine devices (%)Injectables (%)Implants (%)Public sectorGovernment hospital40.925.939.4Government health centre35.245.547.4Other public sector sources3.03.06.0Private sectorPrivate hospitals or clinics16.97.15.0Private pharmacy or stores0.812.80.4Other private sector sources3.35.61.8\n\n\nThere were geographical differences in accessing LARCs. Urban dwellers procured LARCs from government hospitals, private clinics, and pharmacy shops with qualified pharmacists (Onwujekwe et al. 2013). In contrast, rural dwellers got theirs mostly from patent medicine dealers (Onwujekwe et al. 2013), probably due to the proximity of these patent medicine shops and high cost transportation from rural to urban regions where bigger health facilities are located. This trend of the patent medicine shops being the most popular source of LARCs in rural regions is worrisome, since most of the patent medicine dealers are untrained (Monjok et al. 2010)\nMost women held the opinion that LARCs were not easily accessible (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). However, the proportion of women who thought that LARCs were not readily accessible decreased consistently with increase in educational status and residence in urban areas (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). Hence, one can infer that with exposure to education, women become well informed on the various means of accessing LARCs and are financially capable of purchasing them.\nAlthough a good number of Nigerian women desire them (The RESPOND Project 2013), there are certain barriers to accessing the wide variety of LARCs available. First, is the reduced availability of LARCs in certain family planning clinics (Oye-Adeniran et al. 2005; The RESPOND Project 2013). The RESPOND project, reported feedback by one of the service providers where she buttressed this challenge:\n“..Sometimes we run out of stock but not too frequently; when that happens, I will go into the market to get some so that we will have the methods, because we are mindful of our clients’ appointment dates…. I used to tell the community that the IUD is now costly because we used to get it from black market in Makurdi…” (The RESPOND Project 2013)\n—Service provider, Adikpo, Benue State, Nigeria\nThe lack of basic supplies and equipment most often lead providers to charge unauthorized fees that some women cannot afford or request clients to purchase LARC supplies from the black market notorious for its uncertain quality (The RESPOND Project 2013). Second, some family planning clinics are in a poor state of repair, and many had either no or only intermittent electricity all of which discourages women (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nThe third barrier to accessing LARCs is the shortage of skilled providers to deliver LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). For instance, although the policy that permits Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to deliver Injectables was approved in 2012, only few CHEWs have received formal training on how to deliver the method properly (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Regarding other LARCs, Implants were introduced on a larger scale in the public sector only in 2006, and it is plausible that many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public system (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Many experienced Family Planning (FP) providers cited the lack of continuing education and training as the reason for the rather reduced skill set in administering LARCs, pointing to the 1980s as the last time that large-scale FP training efforts were in place (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014)."

    "text": "3.5 Effectiveness and safety profile of LARCs\nGenerally, LARCs were found to be a highly effective method of birth control, with several studies reporting no accidental pregnancies (Pearl index= 0) (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Aisien 2007; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Balogun et al. 2014; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Farr et al. 1996; Ladipo et al. 1993; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; Roberts et al. 2015). While there were a few reports of unintended pregnancies, the failure rate was very minimal, ranging from 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Although a relatively high failure rate of 3.7 percent was reported among IUD users in Abia State (Chigbu et al. 2010), unexpected pregnancy was observed in just one out of the 27 IUD users. Larger studies, however, revealed that IUDs, particularly Copper T-380A, were effective in over 99 percent of users (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; Fakeye 1991; Farr et al. 1996; Obi and Anya 2000). Similar high rates were found among users of progesterone-only injectables, notably Depot Medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Akadri and Odelola 2017; Chigbu et al. 2010; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), and contraceptive subdermal implants, such as Implanon® (Balogun et al. 2014; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Roberts et al. 2015) Jadelle® (Enyindah and Kasso 2011) and Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ladipo et al. 1993; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010). A study in Jos reported one failure (3.3 percent) among 30 women who requested for and had Implanon® rods removed (Mutihir and Nyango 2010). However, this failure was due to inadvertent insertion of the implant during pregnancy.\nWhile LARCs were generally reported to be safe, the chief complaints were menstrual abnormalities (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah and Kasso 2011; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Farr et al. 1996; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006; Obi and Anya 2000; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009; Roberts et al. 2015). Secondary amenorrhea was the most prevalent menstrual disturbance among women using progesterone-only injectables (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008) and reported to a lesser extent by users of IUDs (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and subdermal implants (Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Roberts et al. 2015). One study in Enugu, however, reported amenorrhea as the main side effect experienced by Jadelle® users (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Other menstrual disturbances associated with the use of LARCs include irregular bleeding, heavy/prolonged bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. Also frequently reported complaints were lower abdominal pain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Aisien 2007; Chigbu et al. 2010; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009) and vaginal discharge. Breast pain was also reported with the use of implants (Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014). There were also considerable cases of weight gain (Aniekan M. Abasiattai, Udoma, and Ukeme 2010 Apr-Jun; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) and a far lesser proportion of weight loss (Chigbu et al. 2010; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012) among women using contraceptive injectables. Interestingly, there were a few reports of weight gain in users of IUDs and Implant, with one study in Jos reporting an average weight gain of 2.6kg among users of Copper T-380A (Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006). Meanwhile, Sagay et al. suggested that Norplant tends to prolong PR and QRS electrocardiogram intervals (Sagay et al. 2008). Similarly, hypertension was associated with the use of injectables (Akadri and Odelola 2017; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010), though report. Expulsion and missing IUDs were also reported in a few studies (A. M. Abasiattai, Bassey, and Udoma 2008; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Obi and Anya 2000; Michael Abiola Okunlola et al. 2009)."

    "text": "3.6 Enablers and barriers to adoption of LARCs\nLack of knowledge, not being married, fear of the procedure, dislike of foreign body, inability to access LARCs, husband’s objection, fear of side effects/complications, fear of infertility, need for further counselling, high cost of LARCs, preference for natural methods, lack of knowledge on provider centers, inadequate information on the benefits of LARCs, conﬂicts with their religious and cultural beliefs were the major reasons given by the women for not using LARCs (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Egede et al. 2015; Eke and Alabi-Isama 2011; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Konje et al. 1998; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ojo, Ndikom, and Alabi 2020; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; Onwuhafua et al. 2005; Orji and Onwudiegwu 2002; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977). In their study, Eke and Alabi-Isama (2011) reported that most adolescent females thought that LARCs should not be used by unmarried women.Other barriers to the use of LARCs include cultural bias (certain cultures are highly supportive of large family size), myths and misconceptions about LARCs, gender inequity, religious beliefs, fear of infection and reduction/loss of libido (Adinma, Agbai, and Nwosu 1998; Aduloju et al. 2021; Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011; Ukaegbu 1977).\nShortage of skilled providers to deliver available LARC services is a major barrier to the uptake of LARCs. As stated earlier, only few approved CHEWs have actually received formal training on delivering injectables (i.e., providing the necessary counselling, screening for pregnancy, and delivering the actual injection) [29]. In the North, women rely on CHEWs with at least two years of post-secondary school education as the primary point of care (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). In addition to their primary responsibility in delivering LARCs, these CHEWs often function as the sole staff members of Primary Health Care Centers, providing all the care in the community and sometimes delivering services for which they are not properly trained (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). As at October 2018, 65 percent of Nigerian health facilities have a LARC-trained service provider (Bietsch, Williamson, and Reeves 2020). But only 36 percent of these facilities provided LARCs to women at the same period. This shortage maybe because many providers who received training are no longer practicing in the public sector or that commodities, tool and job aids for delivering services are unavailable (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013, 2020).\nSome studies indicated that many service providers contributed to barriers to uptake by restricting access, based on their personal cultural/social norms or client’s personal characteristics (i.e. age, parity, and marital status) (Camara et al. 2017; Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). A 2017 study which reviewed restrictions to contraceptive access imposed by service providers (nurses/midwives, patent and proprietary medicine vendors, CHEWs and pharmacists), showed that service preferences were given to clients who were married or older than 24yrs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). Similarly, the performance monitoring for action (PMA) 2020’s Adolescents and Young Adults Health Brief indicated that unmarried individuals might be able to services for male condoms and emergency contraceptives – but are less likely to access same for LARCs (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). As a result, unmarried individuals might choose not to use LARCs or opt for methods that are more likely accessible but less effective (International Planned Parenthood Federation 2020). The unavailability of adequate youth-friendly Family Planning service points may be the biggest factor in preventing adolescents from accessing LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother salient barrier to the uptake of LARCs which has most often been over-looked is the poor integration of family planning services (including LARCs) with maternal and new-born health, childhood immunization, nutrition programmes and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Although during pregnancy, women may not actively seek FP information or services, but they often engage proactively with the healthcare system during antenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and ﬁrst year infant immunizations (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These contact points offer valuable and reliable opportunities for healthcare providers to educate the women on LARC services. Some of the challenges of integration of FP with Maternal and Newborn & Child Health (MNCH) include resistance within the separate health programme responsible for FP and Maternal and Child Health services, facility or community-based workers who are not trained or have inadequate staff time to address both MNCH and FP needs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nIncreased stock-outs of commodities due to unavailability or poor quality of actual consumption data to determine the true commodity need, delays in approving the supply plan to commence procurement, poorly implemented annual supply plans and irregular last mile distribution mostly due to lack of funding, limits the provision of quality LARC services (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFear of side effects—real or perceived—is another key barrier hindering the use of LARCs. For example, some women fear that some methods cause excessive bleeding and infertility (Inyang-Etoh and Abah 2017; The RESPOND Project 2013; Udigwe, Udigwe, and Ikechebelu 2002). There were common beliefs that if a woman does not give birth to all the children in her womb, she may develop cancer (The RESPOND Project 2013; Ugboaja et al. 2011). Another commonly held opinion is that a couple should not use any family planning methods early in their childbearing years, to avoid infertility. Some men fear that women become promiscuous when they practice family planning (The RESPOND Project 2013).\nLack of support from the husband not only hinders initial contraceptive use but may also lead to pre- mature termination of use of a long-acting method (Aduloju et al. 2021; Ikechebelu, Joe-Ikechebelu, and Obiajulu 2005; Onwuzurike and Uzochukwu 2001; The RESPOND Project 2013). To resolve this and achieve their birth-limiting goals, some women use contraceptive methods covertly, although such behavior may result in serious marital disharmony if the husband learns of it (The RESPOND Project 2013).Most women thought that negotiating and deciding with their husbands prior the use of any LARC method was necessary (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; The RESPOND Project 2013). But in reality, men alone played the dominant role in women’s decision to adopt long-acting reversible contraception and in the choice of method (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Omu and Unuigbe 1986; The RESPOND Project 2013). The dominant role of men affected the use of LARCs because men generally demonstrated less favorable attitudes toward family planning than women and were less knowledgeable about LARCs (The RESPOND Project 2013). Hence, a woman’s ability to control her fertility and her choice of long-acting reversible contraception were partly determined by her empowerment status and self-image (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). A woman who is unable to control her life may be less likely to feel she can make and carry out decisions about her fertility (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004)."

    "section": "3.7 LARCs discontinuation prevalence and associated factors",
    "text": "3.7 LARCs discontinuation prevalence and associated factors\nThe discontinuation rate varied considerably across the different LARCs types and with the duration of usage. Unsurprisingly, there was an increase in discontinuation rates over time, particularly for injectables which typically require two-monthly or three-monthly administration. Moreover, the rate of discontinuation at 12 months of use was highest among women using DMPA injectables, ranging from 50 percent to 62 percent (Chigbu et al. 2010; Fakeye 1991; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Ogedengbe et al. 1987). However, in Osogbo a slightly lower rate of 22.4 percent was observed (A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012). Interestingly, an Enugu study documented a low discontinuation rate (12.8 percent) even at 36 months (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Ojule, Oriji, and Okongwu 2010). Compared to injectables, implants and IUDs had better continuity owing to their longer life span. The 12-month discontinuation rate for IUDs was 10%-22% (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Fakeye 1991; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; van Dierendonck et al. 1992), while those for implants were 1-8 percent for Implanon® (Ezegwui et al. 2011; Mutihir and Duru 2008)and 5.4-9.8% for Norplant® (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Fakeye 1991). Jadelle®, a relatively new contraceptive implant in Nigeria, had no discontinuations among users in Rivers State (Enyindah and Kasso 2011). Ogedengbe et al. (1987), however, observed comparable discontinuation rates between IUDs (45.6%) and Injectables (50.2%). For Norplant®, after 36 months, approximately 11-18% of users had discontinued use (Aisien 2007; Ekabua and Itam 2007; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998).\nSide effects/health concerns were the primary reason for discontinuing LARCs. Common side effects like changes in menstrual cycle, irregular spotting of blood through the vagina and amenorrhea have been associated to the use of progestogen-only methods (Okafor 2018). To reduce the occurrence of side-effects and promote use, LARCs should be selected based on informed decisions. This is an important principle in the delivery of LARCs (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004). Women using LARCs should also be counseled, so they can cope easily with side effects, to avoid dissatisfactions and unnecessary discontinuations of the methods (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2019, 2009, 2014; National Population Commission, and ORC Macro 2004).\nThe most frequently reported reasons for discontinuing LARCs were the desire for pregnancy (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Aisien 2007; Balogun et al. 2014; Ekabua and Itam 2007; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Mutihir, Aisien, and Ujah 2010; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Ogedengbe et al. 1987; M. A. Okunlola et al. 2006; Sagay et al. 2008; van Dierendonck et al. 1992) and menstrual side effects (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Ezegwui et al. 2011; Fakeye 1991; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012; Mutihir and Nyango 2010; Obi and Anya 2000; Oyediran and Akinla 1980; B. Ozumba, Chukudebelu, and Snow 1998). Abnormal menstruation, particularly amenorrhea, was a commonly cited reason by users of contraceptive injectable (Adaji, Shittu, and Sule 2005; A. S. Adeyemi and Adekanle 2012; Chigbu et al. 2010; Falase, Otolorin, and Ladipo 1989; Hu, Ikeako, and Obiora-Okafor 2012). Spousal factors such as husband’s objection and husband’s deaths were also linked with discontinuation (F. O. Ezugwu and Anya 2005). Expulsion of contraceptive devices was also reported among IUD users (Adegbola and Okunowo 2009; Enyindah, Ojule, and Bassey 2012; Fakeye 1991; Mutihir, Iranloye, and Uduagbamen 2006; Naghma-E-Rehan, McFarlane, and Sani 1984; Ogedengbe et al. 1987)."

    "section": "3.8 Policy environment on LARCs in Nigeria",
    "text": "3.8 Policy environment on LARCs in Nigeria\nThe Federal Government of Nigeria (FGON) have made considerably good strides in creating an enabling environment for LARCs to thrive (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013). For instance, certain positive policy reforms have occurred, notably the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy which allows CHEWs to administer Injectables (they are still restricted from providing IUDs and implants) (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014, 2020). Additional reforms include making LARCs free in public-sector clinics and reforming the nurse/midwife training curriculum to make it proficiency-based and supported by rigorous supervision (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2013; Shelton and Finkle 2016). These policy reforms yielded some success in the uptake of LARCs. For instance, between 2008 and 2013, the use of Implants increased from 0.4 to 3.4 percent (National Population Commission, and ICF International 2009, 2014). Nigeria’s Family Planning Effort (FPE) ratings in 2014 also indicate notable progress in Policies and Access (Avenir Health 2016). Nevertheless, the country’s FPE scores, are still very low compared to other countries in the region (Avenir Health 2016). Hence, intensive efforts are needed to significantly improve Nigeria’s FP policy and program environment (Avenir Health 2016).\nCurrently, there are at least four plans with Family Planning/Reproductive Health goals associated with them. These are the National LARC Strategy, the Reproductive Health Commodity Strategy, the National Strategic Health Development Plan, and the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) Strategy (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2014). Other important policies include the National Youth Policy 2009, Gender Policy 2008, National Policy on Health and Development of Adolescents and Young People in Nigeria 2007, and the National School Health Policy 2006. The School Health Policy provides the framework for implementing the national school health program (Cortez et al. 2015).\nAdditionally, the FGON committed to further creating an enabling environment for family planning activities (including LARCs). This commitment was buttressed in the following actions: revitalizing its commitment in the 2017 Summit on Family Planning, developing a national guideline to scale-up private providers’ access to government’s free FP commodities, reviewing the National Reproductive Health Policy and The Reproductive Health Strategic Framework and developing an accelerated introduction and scale-up plan for the Subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) to increase access to injectable contraceptives (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nHowever, there are still some gaps in some of the policies, especially pertaining access to family planning services and rights to adolescents and youths (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Currently, reproductive health policies do not indicate unrestricted access to family planning (including LARCs) services for youths, without provider discretion, parental or spousal consent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). . Most policies and national documents are vague on the age of consent for youths (i.e. age of consent) [Power et al., 2021]. These documents do not explicitly state the youth’s legal right to freely and independently access a full range of contraceptive services, including LARCs (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Hence, health providers choosing to provide service to adolescents and youth are not protected by any policy statement that legally authorizes health providers to offer contraceptive services to this age group (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nFurthermore, the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy does not adequately recognize the large resource pool of providers within the healthcare system that can offer some LARC services (e.g., injectables) These healthcare providers include; the Junior Community Health Extension Worker (JCHEWs), Community Pharmacists, Community Midwives and PPMVs. Inclusion of these providers in the Task Shifting and Sharing Policy is vital as these cadre could play important roles in providing LARCs to women since in a large proportion of rural facilities, they may be the only available healthcare providers (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\nAnother policy challenge is the poor translation of existing policies to action (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). There is a recurrent challenge of timely and effective implementation of most policies/guidelines (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). This is especially so because the autonomy of adoption and implementation of policies made by the Federal Ministry of Health falls on the State Ministry of Health. For example, since the approval of the Task Shifting Policy in 2012, as at 2019, 13 states are yet to begin domestication (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). Likewise, for the National FP Blueprint, 14 states are yet to domesticate the plan to state level costed implementation plans since its launch in 2014 (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020).\n\nTable 1: Summary of policy challenges |——–|——–|——–|——————————————-|——–| | | | | | | | | S/N | | Policy Challenges | | | | | | | | | | 1. | | Inadequate policies supporting Adolescent and Youth Family Planning | | | | | | | | | | 2. | | Ambiguities in existing Family Planning policies (especially around adolescent and youth | | | | | | | | | | 3. | | Poor translation of existing policies to action | | | | | | | |\nSource: Nigeria Family Planning Blue Print (2020-2024), 2020."

    "text": "3.9 Programs and initiatives to increase LARCs uptake\nSeveral programs and initiatives have been launched to support the government’s efforts to increase uptake of LARCs and utmostly achieve the national family planning goals of a modern contraceptive prevalence of 27 percent (Federal Ministry of Health [Nigeria] 2020). These programs have strikingly increased the provision of LARCs in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016). The most recent includes:\n· The Marie Stopes Nigeria “BlueStar” social franchising program 2012: This supports more than 300 private-sector providers, particularly in the South, of whom about 70% are midwives. The midwives in turn provided a notably large number of women—more than 65,000—with contraception, especially implants, in 2015.\n· The Society for Family Health’s “Healthy Family Network social franchising program, with more than 300 service providers, has likewise been successful, although more with the IUDs.\n· DKT International also launched a program that gives support to private providers, particularly in the South. Its model consists primarily of marketing contraceptive products to providers and distributors, without the networking and other components of social franchising. LARC sales in 2015 was at more than 100,000 which is striking.\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria commenced a program focused on deploying “mobile outreach” teams in the North. These mobile outreaches typically occur in collaboration with the public sector and in public-sector sites. Remarkably, with only 8 outreach teams, they provided about 63,000 clients with LARCs in 2015, primarily implants\n· Marie Stopes Nigeria also began the Family Health Plus initiative in 2014. It works with public-sector providers at the state level, now expanded to 20 states, emphasizing training, supportive supervision, and supply chain. Again, providing LARCs to more than 250,000 clients in 2015.\nMore than 550,000 women have received LARCs from just these 5 initiatives, representing over 2% of married women of reproductive age and 1.5% of all women of reproductive age in Nigeria (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nLARCs engender high rates of satisfaction and continuation, the sustained cumulative effect of these programs over a period of time would be substantial. For instance, between 2014 and 2015, the share of overall modern contraceptive use for implants in Kaduna state (where Family Health Plus, Healthy Family Network, Marie Stopes Nigeria mobile outreach, and Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative as well as others) are all active, increased from 16 percent to 28 percent [Nigeria - Kaduna and Lagos Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 Survey, Round 2 2015 | GHDx, n.d.).\nFurthermore, these programs have provided proof for many vague concepts about LARC uptake in Nigeria. First, it can now be firmly stated that LARCs are highly acceptable for Nigerian women desiring contraception (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Second, promoting equity by providing LARC services in very low-income as well as higher-income clients is highly efficient (Shelton and Finkle 2016). A precedent, indicates that 75 percent, 53 percent, and 49 percent of Marie Stopes Nigeria’s mobile outreach, Family Health Plus, and social franchising clients, respectively, were from households living on less than US$2.50 per day (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Third, success is attainable in every geographical zone in Nigeria. While it is generally held that the more conservative North is highly resistant to family planning, these projects—notably, mobile outreach and the Family Health Plus public-sector support project demonstrate that with concerted efforts, success can be achieved in the North as well (Shelton and Finkle 2016). Fourth, the Family Health Plus program showed that despite the public sector’s reputation as a weak service delivery platform, when the private sector works closely with the government, public-sector service delivery on LARCs can be successful (Shelton and Finkle 2016).\nTable 2: Provision of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods by Selected Program Initiatives, Nigeria, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\nImplants\nIUDs\nTotal\n\n\nBlue Star (Marie Stopes Nigeria\n51,643\n13,811\n65,454\n\n\nHealthy Family Network (SFH)\n20,273\n53,900\n74,173\n\n\nDKT International sales\n15,967\n87,600\n103,567\n\n\nMobile outreaches (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n53,786\n9,200\n62,986\n\n\nFamily Health Plus (Marie Stopes Nigeria)\n222,705\n29,686\n252,391\n\n\nTotal\n364,374\n194,197\n558,571\n\n\n\nSource: For Marie Stopes Nigeria - personal communication with Anna Mackay; Deputy Director of SIFPO Project for Marie Stopes International; for SFH - personal communication with Peter Entonu, (Associate Director of Social Franchise Unit); for DKT, sales report from December 2015.\nIn addition to the programs described above, a number of other worthwhile initiatives are ongoing in Nigeria, including traditional social marketing and clinic-based public-sector and NGO service (Shelton and Finkle 2016)."

    "text": "2.1 Data Sources\nWe used data from the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey of 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 for this study [1–3,20]. The survey is a nationally representative survey of Nigerian households. Women aged 15-49 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors who spent the previous night in the household. A total of 7,620; 33,385; 38,948 and 41,821 women aged 15-49 were interviewed in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 surveys. The survey collected various information from women including fertility preference, sexual activity, and reproductive history, alongside background characteristics.\nThe key background variables considered in this study were percentage of women with secondary education or above, percentage of women working in the labour force, percentage of women living in urban residence, percentage of women in different geographical zones. The TFR was calculated from births and exposure during the three years (36 months) prior to each woman’s month of interview. The nominal date of a TFR is the year of the survey, but the reference period is prior to that. The reference period for the proximate determinants is also prior to the date of interview except for contraception, which is based on current contraceptive use. In terms of synchronization, the link between fertility and contraception is problematic. For individual women, contraception affects subsequent fertility, but in the data, fertility s measured for an earlier date than contraception.\nFor the estimation of index of abortion, we used the total abortion rate (TAR) reported in a survey by Guttmacher Institute [21]. The survey estimated the TAR using data on delivery of abortion and post-abortion care services from a nationally representative sample of 772 health facilities in 2012. The TAR obtained from his study was kept constant for all years of the analysis – 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018."

    "section": "2.2 Data analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Data analysis\nThis study examines the contributions of biological and behavioural determinants to fertility change, as well as the effects of the socio-economic and geographic factors through which the determinants exert their influence. Statistical analyses for inputs in the model were performed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) and confirmed with published DHS reports for inputs available in the reports. The proximate determinants of fertility, potential fertility and background variables were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. In the following section we present detailed analysis of fertility differentials that quantifies the negative and positive effects of each of the socio-economic and geographic factors on fertility through various intermediate fertility variables.\n\n2.2.1 Proximate determinants: The Bongaart’s Model\nWe used a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Each of the determinants is assumed to independently inhibit fertility. In the original model, Bongarts identified the following: an index for marriage, contraception, abortion and post-partum infecundity and expressed TFR as the product of the four indices together with total fecundity (TF) - the average number of live births expected among women during their entire lifetime, [9].\n\\[\nTFR = C_m\\:*\\:C_{i}\\:*\\:C_{c}\\:*\\:C_{a}\\:*\\:TF\n\\]\nwhere, TFR is the total fertility rate, Cm is the index of proportion married, Ci is the index of post-partum infecundability, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Cc is the index of contraception. The indices only take values between 0 and 1. If the corresponding index is of no fertility inhibition effect, the index equals 1; an index of 0 which is not empirically proven, indicates total inhibition effect [9].\nA revision of this model attempted to account for overlaps between the determinants, specifically between postpartum amenorrhea and contraceptive use [10]. The revised framework used for this study includes five intermediate fertility variables; proportion sexually exposed, postpartum infecundability, contraception, induced abortion, and sterility which are key direct determinants of fertility. From the original model, the index of marriage was revised to include women who have been in a sexual union in the last month, use contraceptives, are pregnant or post-partum infecundable. This index was renamed index of sexual exposure [10]. The index of post-partum infecundability was modified to post-partum insusceptibility including both median duration of post-partum amenorrhea and post-partum abstinence. The index of abortion was revised by multiplying contraceptive prevalence with average use effectiveness of contraception [10].\nThe index of sterility was modified from proportion of women 45-49 years old who had no live births to the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund. Index of contraception was revised to the proportion of sexually active fecund women using contraceptives that do not overlap with those experiencing postpartum amenorrhea and the average effectiveness of contraception [10]. The revised equation relating the total fertility rate to the proximate determinants used in this study is expressed as:\n\\[\nTFR=PF\\:*\\:C_{x}\\:*\\:C_{u}\\:*C_{a}\\:*C_{i}\\:*C_{f}\\:\n\\]\nWhere TFR is the total fertility rate, PF is the potential fertility, Cx represents the index of sexual exposure, Cu is the index of contraception, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Ci is the index of postpartum insusceptibility and Cf represents the index of sterility. Estimates from empirical data showed an average potential fertility of 21 (18-24) births per woman for the 35-year reproductive period from age 15 to 49 years [10]. Nonetheless, estimates of PF may exceed its theoretical limits because of a large error term in the proximate determinants’ framework, attributed in a large part to the effects of unmeasured factors exogenous to the framework [22].\n\n\n2.2.2 The index of sexual exposure (Cx)\nThe index of sexual exposure expresses the reduction in fertility caused by women’s not being sexually active throughout their entire reproductive period. The index is calculated as:\n\\[\nC_x=\\:s\n\\]\nwhere s is the proportion of women aged 15-49 who are sexually active (women who either are pregnant, report sex in the last month, use contraception, or are postpartum infecundable). The index of sexual exposure, Cx, equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are sexually active during the entire reproductive period and 0 in the absence of such.\n\n\n2.2.3 The index of contraception (Cc)\nThis considers both the level of contraceptive prevalence and the average effectiveness of contraceptive methods used. It is estimated as:\n\\[\nC_c=\\:1\\:-\\:1.08ue\n\\]\nwhere u is the proportion of women in the reproductive ages who are currently using contraception among those sexually active, excluding exclude those infecund and postpartum amenorrhic within 6 months after birth; and e is the average of use-effectiveness of contraception as practiced in the population. Estimates of the method-specific effectiveness are: sterilization (0.995), pill (0.930), injectable (0.970), implant (0.999), intra-uterine device (0.993), male condom (0.870), and other modern methods (0.800) [23].\n\n\n2.2.4 The index of sexual abortion (Ca)\nThe index of abortion is the proportion by which the PF is reduced due to induced abortion. Births averted per induced abortion are related to contraceptive use [22]. The index of abortion is defined as the ratio of the observed TFR to the estimated TFR without induced abortion, and declines with increasing incidence of induced abortion [10]. This index is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nC_a=\\frac{TFR}{TFR\\:+\\:0.4\\:*\\:(1\\:+\\:u)\\:*\\:TAR}\n\\]\nwhere TFR is the total fertility rate, u represents the proportion protected by contraception among women who have an induced abortion and TAR is the total abortion rate which is the average number of induced abortions per married or in-union woman at the end of the reproductive period if induced abortions remain at prevailing levels. The index of induced abortion equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Reliable data on the total abortion rate for all years is not available. We assumed abortion rates prevailing in 2012 [21], will remain constant throughout 2018.\n\n\n2.2.5 The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci)\nThe index of postpartum infecundability represents the reduced risk of exposure to conception immediately following a birth [24]. In the absence of any breastfeeding (and postpartum abstinence), the average birth interval is around 20 months, which includes four segments: a period of postpartum amenorrhea (1.5 months), the average waiting time to conception (7.5 months), time added by spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months) and 9 months of a full term pregnancy. The last three segments are assumed constant and sum up to 18.5 months. Postpartum amenorrhea is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. The index of postpartum infecundability is estimated by the ratio of the average birth interval where breastfeeding and abstinence are absent, and the length of a birth interval where the period of postpartum infecundability is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. It is estimated using the formula:\n\\[\nC_i\\:=\\:\\frac{20}{18.5\\:+\\:i}\n\\]\nwhere Ci = index of postpartum infecundability; and i = average duration of postpartum infecundability due to breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence. In the absence of breastfeeding and abstinence, i would be equal to 1.5, its minimum possible value, and Ci would equal 1. As the duration of postpartum infecundability increases, Ci declines and it would tend towards 0 if the duration of postpartum infecundability were to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n2.2.6 The index of sterility (Cs)\nCs measures the incidence of natural infertility and pathological sterility. This index expresses the total effect of infecundity because of a pathological condition. The net effect of pathological sterility would be the difference between the actual index and some base value that represents natural infecundity. The formula for measuring the index of sterility is represented as:\n\\[\nC_f~=\\:1\\:-\\:f\n\\]\nwhere f is defined as the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund."

    "text": "2.3 Background and institutional factors\nIn this study, we assessed the socio-economic or contextual characteristics that influence fertility through changes in the proximate determinants. These were the level of education, female participation in the workforce, wealth quintile, geopolitical regions and type of residence. Each of these factors has well established associations with fertility [25]. We examined fertility preferences through the ideal number of children and desire for more children. The DHS asks women with living children, “If you could go back to the time [when] you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” For women who are yet to give birth, the question is framed as “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019). We considered only numeric responses. The survey also asked women whether they wanted more children in addition to those they have, thus reflecting desire for further reproduction.\nThe study also tracked four indicators of women’s fertility preferences. The key indicators that reflect fertility-related international policy and program priorities include planning status for most recent birth in the past five years, percent of children born to mothers under age 18, percent of children born to mothers over age 34, and the median length of the birth interval (in months). We assessed the strength of Nigeria’s Family planning programs using the Family Planning Effort Index (FPEI) and National Composite Index on Family Planning (NCIFP). The FPE has been collected periodically since 1972, and provides results across four key components: policies, services, evaluation, and access [26]. The index was developed to measure the level of effort that goes into FP programs, and to track how these changes over time. The NCIPF measures the existence and implementation of family planning policies and program under five components: strategy, data, quality, equity, and accountability. It is built on the FPEIS framework [27]."

    "text": "2.4 Results\nThe indices of direct biological and behavioural determinants of fertility from Bongaarts models is shown in Table 1. The behavioural indices include index of sexual exposure (Cx), index of contraception (Cc)and index of abortion (Ca) while the index of sterility (Cs) is a biological determinant. Postpartum infecundability (Ci) is a function of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence. The duration of amenorrhea is a function of the normal length of amenorrhea after childbirth women which is due to breastfeeding practices. The duration of abstinence is entirely behavioural.\n\n\n\nEstimated Indices for Proximate Determinants of Fertility, DHS\n2003-2018YearCxCiCaCfCuPFSurvey TFRModel TFR20030.700.590.940.810.8521.005.655.6520080.700.620.940.820.8220.725.725.8020130.720.640.940.800.8119.485.505.9320180.680.640.940.800.8219.615.295.67Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2003-2018\n\n\nCi was the lowest among the indices in our study at 0.64 in the 2018 survey. This implies that postpartum infecundability is associated with reduction of potential fertility by 36% from its biological maximum. Delayed sexual exposure (Cx) inhibited fertility by 32% being the second most effective ferility reducing factor. The index of abortion was high at 0.94. Hence, abortion [28–30]. This index is therefore excluded from the discussions. The other reductions in PF occurred because of inability to bear children (Cf, 0.80) and effects from the use of contraceptive technologies (Cu, 0.82). The lowest contributor is the index of contraception, contributing to 18% reduction in PF. There were little changes during the period of the survey in the 5 indices.\nThe revised Bongaart’s model gave an estimated TFR of 5.67, which is 0.38 children higher than TFR measured by DHS survey in 2018 (5.29). The analysis arrived at similar values for 2003 (5.65 each). Any difference between these sets of TFRs may be due to underestimation in DHS samples, inaccuracies in the data, inexactitude in our estimation of the indices, or other factors left out of the model. Nevertheless, the model shows the relative contributions of the determinants, and enables us report variations between socio-economic and geographic groups, as well as changes over the years of the surveys 2003-2018.\nThe influence of the proximate determinants and their variability by these background factors are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2003 respectively. The study shows that for 2018, attainment of secondary education is associated with relatively low indices for sexual exposure (0.58) and contraception (0.62). Across the educational attainment levels, these two indices have an inverse relationship in all years of the survey. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability increases with additional educational attainment. This would reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Concerning disparity in place of residence and wealth, Cx was higher among rural residents in all years (rural - 0.74, urban - 061). This means sexual exposure inhibited fertility by 33.5% among rural residents, and 39% among city dwellers. On the contrary, the Ci was higher among urban residents (rural - 0.61, urban - 0.68). Contribution of sterility to reducing PF is not dependent on place of residence, as Cf in all years were within ±0.03 units. As expected, the index of contraception is higher in rural areas relative to urban population, reflecting a higher contraceptive use among sexually exposed female urban dwellers. There also are notable differences between women of different wealth quintiles. The values of the indices are lower for women in higher wealth quintiles, meaning a higher depression of fertility, with exception of Ci. The Ci increases progressively along the wealth quintiles (lowest - 0.56, second - 0.61, middle - 0.64, fourth - 0.68, highest - 0.75) in 2018, as well as across all the years of the survey.\nWorkforce participation is associated with a lower fertility in 2018, with no notable difference in preceding years. In the latest year of the survey, the estimated TFR among women in workforce was 5.22, compared to 5.93 in women without workforce participation. In 2013 however, the reverse was the case (in workforce - 5.76, not in workforce - 5.62) The differences were negligible in 2008 (in workforce – 5.93, not in workforce - 5.99), and 2003 (in workforce - 5.78, not in workforce - 5.74). In all years, the index of contraception contributed more to depression of fertility among those in workforce compared to those not active in workforce. In contrast, the index of marriage and index of sterility contributed more to fertility reduction among women of reproductive age not active in workforce.

The family planning effort index (FEPI) is based on the aggregate of four dimensions of family planning effort (policies, services, evaluation, and method access). Raw scores were converted to percentages and are reported. FEPI increased between 1972 and 1999, then reduced through 2009, before increasing to 41% in 2014. The increase in FEPI to its all-time highest in 1999 corresponds to the lowest survey TFR recorded in Nigeria, 5.11 in 1999 [31]. During this time, access to contraceptives was high at 70.3%, and evaluation of services rendered stood at 81.4% (see Supplementary Information). The FEPI has since been replaced by another measure, the National Composite Index on Family Planning, NCIFP (see Supplementary Information). The most recent NCIFP in 2017 assessed the strategy (score - 62.4%), data (65.5%), quality (62.0%), accountability (39.0%) and equity (58.0%) of family planning in Nigeria. On all measures, the scores in 2017 (composite index - 62.4%) were higher than those in 2014 (composite index - 49.5%).\n{fig-fp-effort-index}\nLastly, the study includes some outcome indicators. The state of planning for new births and incidence of births among the young and aged population are a reflection of policy priorities concerning reproductive options available to women. [25]. Among 12.2% of women aged 15-49 years with at least one child, the most recent birth was planned i.e. they wanted to have their last child at the time. There has been no notable increase in the median birth interval. The percentage of births to women less than 18 years of age has steadily reduced from 8.9% in 2003 to 6.0% in 2018. Overall, after an initial increase between 2003 and 2008, the percentage of births to women older than 34 years has remained relatively unchanged.\n\n\n\nSome Women Reproductive Options Outcome IndicatorsOutcome Indicator2003200820132018Proportion that planned most recent birth (%)16.711.99.812.2Median birth intervals (in months)31.231.331.730.9Proportion of births to women &lt;18 years (%)8.97.37.16.0Proportion of births to women &gt;34 years (%)14.415.315.315.0"

    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nThis study used the revised Bongaart’s model to show contributions of the biological and behavioural determinants of fertility in Nigeria, and the effects of selected socio-economic and geographical variables. We found that postpartum infecundability consistently had the strongest inhibitory effect on fertility rates from 2003 to 2018, closely followed by delayed sexual exposure and sterility. In contrast, abortion had the least inhibitory effect, proceeded by contraception use. Regarding socio-economic and geographical correlates, our study shows that the inhibitory effect of contraception, abortion, delayed sexual exposure were more evident among highly educated and rich women residing in urban areas of Southern Nigeria. Additionally, the recent index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate an increase in family planning program efforts from 2014 to 2017. We also found that fertility levels were highest in the Northwest and lowest in Southwest, and this pattern was consistent from 2003 to 2018.\nOne of the most significant findings in our study was that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. A plausible explanation for the dominant inhibiting effect of postpartum infecundability could be the effect of prolonged breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea. There is a clear association between the duration and intensity of breastfeeding, the length of postpartum amenorrhea, and postpartum infecundability. For instance, [24] demonstrated that the risk of conception increases in the absence of breastfeeding after postpartum menstruation resumes. Similar studies conducted in Nigeria [32] and other sub-Saharan African countries including Zambia [13], Malawi [33] and Ethopia [8], have also indicated that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. Recognizing the impact of postpartum infecundability on fertility rates has key policy implications for addressing Nigeria’s high fertility rates. Analysis of the effect of education and wealth on postpartum infecundability highlighted a positive correlation between postpartum infecundability and additional educational attainment. This is similar to findings by [34], and reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Asides postpartum infecundability, delayed sexual exposure and sterility were the major contributors to the reduced fertility levels in Nigeria. The contribution of delayed sexual exposure to reduced TFRs in the Southern regions reflects a higher awareness and uptake of contraception, as well as the postponement of the age of first marriage in the Southern region (usually due to education) compared to the Northern region [35].\nAbortion and contraception had the least inhibitory effects on fertility. Unlike previous studies on the proximate determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa [13,36], we were able to estimate the index of abortion in this study. The reduced inhibitory effect of abortion may be attributed to its illegal status in Nigeria. Abortion is only allowed when it is necessary to save a woman’s life. [21]. Sociocultural and religious norms surrounding induced abortion in Nigeria could also contribute to its diminished impact on fertility rates [21]. Increased contraceptive intake is typically associated with reduced fertility rates [37]. As a result, we initially hypothesized that the intensified national family planning efforts would result in a higher inhibitory effect of contraception on fertility rates. However, our study showed that the use of contraception only accounted for only 18% in fertility reduction in 2018. Similar to our finding, a previous study conducted in Uganda [38] also found that contraception had the least inhibitory effect on fertility. Both findings contrasts the study by Mahjabeen and Khan [34] who found that contraception had the highest impact on reducing fertility, accounting for 51% of the decrease in TFR in Zambia. Potential reasons for the high inhibitory effect of contraception in Zambia include cultural acceptance and availability of contraception, education and awareness about family planning, and government policies and programs promoting contraception use.\nThe relationship between socio-economic and geographical correlates can be clearly seen in this study. We found that the 5 proximate determinants considered in this study varied with education, wealth, workforce participation and residence. Sexual exposure had a higher inhibitory effect on rural residents than urban residents, probably due to factors such as limited access to family planning services, lower socioeconomic development, cultural and religious beliefs, and reduced health information and awareness. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve access to contraception, address socioeconomic challenges, provide health education, and consider cultural and religious contexts in rural communities. Contraception use had a higher inhibitory effect on fertility in urban residents compared to rural residents. One reason could be that urban women are more likely to use contraceptives than are rural women. Another reason could be that women who are highly educated, and lived in urban regions tend to delay marriage and are more likely to use modern methods of contraception [39]. Postpartum infecundability had lesser inhibitory effects on highly educated, rich urban women. This may be correlated with shorter durations of breastfeeding probably due to the intense work schedules common in urban areas.\nThe index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate Nigeria’s significant strides in improving access to family planning services, and reducing the unmet need for contraception (i.e., a larger proportion of individuals who desire to use contraception have access to it). However, it also suggests that providing accessible reproductive options is not currently a primary policy focus in Nigeria. There is need for continued investment and implementation of effective family planning programs to improve program scores, sustain positive implications and achieve the sustainable development goals.\nA major limitation of this study is the reliance on secondary data collected using a cross sectional design study design. Additionally, since the information collected in this study was self-reported, there is risk of responder bias due to cultural beliefs and attitude towards fertility issues. For instance, women tend to omit some of the children they have given birth to, particularly those living in other households and those who have died [40]. Nonetheless, a key strength in our study is that we were able to expand our model to include key contextual factors that affect fertility such as socio-economic status and geographical location that can also significantly influence fertility."

Therefore, we suggest policies that prioritize postpartum health support, raise awareness about postpartum infecundability and its implications for fertility rates, and promote breastfeeding initiatives and family planning programs. These policies should be designed to extend the duration of infecundability, thereby contributing to the reduction of TFRs in Nigeria. We recommend communication and messaging around family planning all require financial resources. It is critical that enough funds are provided to support these efforts.These approaches ought to be specific to the different geopolitical zones since There are varying behavioural and proximate determinants unique to these regions.

    "title": "Labour Absorption and Employment Elasticities in Nigeria",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe ultimate goal of every nation is the well-being of its citizens regardless of its economic, political and social settings. This is reflected by economic development which dwells on growth and distributions as well as their interconnections. A distinctive strength of the informal sector especially its Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) is the effective and efficient absorption of labour and growth in employment.\nLabour is an important factor that enables economic development through the production of goods and services and the satisfaction of individuals’ needs. Economic performance is a function of capital and labour. Economic indicators relating to employment, particularly those that evaluate a country’s ability to provide enough jobs for its people, can give you a lot of information about a country’s overall macroeconomic performance. Unemployment rates, employment-to-population ratios, and labour force participation rates are among the most generally discussed metrics along these lines. The employment intensity of growth or elasticity of employment with regard to output is another labour market indicator that indicates employment growth related to economic growth.\nFor a country like Nigeria, where unemployment rates keep rising and the population also increasing. It is important to understand the past and current employment and absorption capacity of the country as it can provide vital information that can be used for policymaking to curb unemployment.\nHence, it is of the essence that labour absorption and employment elasticities be studied. This analysis uses descriptive methods to analyze labour absorption and employment elasticities in Nigeria.\n\n\nLabour Absorption\nLabour absorption is the level at which the working population are engaged in economic activities at a particular period of time and the metric for labour absorption is “Labour Absorption Rate (LAR)” or “Employment to Population Ratio.”\nAccording to the ILO database, the employment-to-population ratio expresses the number of persons who are employed as a percentage of the total working-age population. In other words, it is the proportion of the working-age population aged 15-65 years that is employed. It measures the proportion of the working-age population that is employed (Ozili 2020)\nMathematically,\n\\[\n\\textrm{Employment To Population Ratio}=\\frac{\\textrm{total Employed}}{\\textrm{Working Age Population}} \\times 100\n\\]\nThe labour absorption rate (LAR) in Nigeria has been on a continual decrease since 2014 with a significant decrease in 2020 as shown in figure 1 below. This shows that the working-age population is growing more compared to the levels of employment (working-age population addition yearly is over a million while for employment is in thousands). The significant decrease in 2020 can be attributed to the pandemic when a lot of jobs were lost and the working-age population kept increasing (Ozili 2020; PwC 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Labour absorption rate in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\nDisaggregating LAR into full and part-time employment brings a better understanding of LAR as shown in figure 2 below. The fall in LAR for full-time employment followed the same pattern as the general LAR which is normal but interestingly part-time employment was on the increase with the exception of 2020, the pandemic year.\nThis is because, following the law governing demand and supply of labour, all things being equal “increase supply of labour leads to decrease in wages”. A decrease in wages implies a decrease in working hours hence increased part-time employment. Due to the increasing nature of the working population and employment increasing at a decreasing rate, the number of hours decreases as a reaction to decreasing in wages.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Labour absorption by employment type\n\n\nFurther, in the analysis, LAR was disaggregated by zone. The descriptive showed nothing out of the normal as shown in figure 3 below. LAR are highest in the two economic zones in Nigeria where the economic hub and the Federal capital territory are located. South-South and North West follow closely with South-South being the domain of oil which is the primary source of revenue for the country and Northwest housing Kano, the business capital in the north. The Northwest has the lowest LAR and this is due to insecurity coupled with the pandemic of 2020 which has shut down most economic activities even agriculture has been disrupted. People are gradually bringing back economic activities and leaving Internal Displaced Persons Camps (IDP camps) to being farming\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Labour absorption by geo-political zones in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Elasticity\nEmployment elasticity (EE) also called “Employment Intensity of Growth” is a measure of the percentage change in employment associated with a percentage point change in growth for a sector or total GDP. The employment elasticity indicates the ability of an economy to generate employment opportunities for its population as a percentage of its growth.\nEmployment is an important element of growth and development; it acts as a link between economic growth and poverty reduction. Employment elasticities are also frequently used to track industry potential for job creation and estimate future employment development.\nMathematically, EE is calculated in two ways;\n1.      The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) method: This method gives the “arc” employment elasticity, this is the elasticity of one variable in relation to another between two given points. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\ne = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nWhere L refers to employment, Y GDP and \\(\\Delta\\) percentage change. Change in GDP is essentially GDP growth rate.\n2.      The Regression approach: This on the other hand provides the “point” elasticity, this is the elasticity at a specific point on the curve. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\nln L = \\alpha + \\beta lnY\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\beta\\) serves as the employment elasticity. When the derivative is taken, we arrive at;\n\\[\ne = \\frac{dlnL}{dlnY} = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nIn a nutshell, EE examines how economic growth (output) and employment evolve together over time. Looking at the EE of Nigeria from 2011 to 2022, EE growth has not been stable as shown below in figure 4. Employment elasticity in 2012, 2016 and 2017 was negative. In 2016 there was a recession and in 2017, Nigeria was still trying to get back on its feet. During a recession, economic growth becomes negative and industries will have to lay off workers or cut wages in other to survive. By 2018, the economy was booming. This shows that a 1 per cent increase in growth led to a 0.5 per cent increase in employment.\nIn 2021 after the pandemic, the economy was recovering from the pandemic shocks and different job opportunities were springing forth which include Artificial intelligence and data analytics which were majorly remote and the barrier for location was eliminated (Jenq, Lain, and Vishwanath 2021; WEF 2020). This explains why the employment elasticity was 7.4 per cent meaning for every 1 per cent increase in growth, employment increased by 7.4 per cent.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Employment elasticity in Nigeria between 2010 and 2022. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is evident from the above data that Nigeria is not doing well when it comes to employment generation and absorbing its working population. A high working-age population implies availability of labour which is an advantage when utilize will boost economic growth substantially.  The continuous decrease in LAR means two things either the job creation level is not growing or the working-age population grows more than the level of employment creation, the latter seems to be most suitable. Another reason for the fall in LAR is the lack of skilled labour to be employed and the information asymmetry that exists in the labour market. Hence there is a need to encourage and build more vocational centers and improve the standard of education. To build an economy that has the capacity to absorb its labour, the quality and skills of workers need to be addressed because increased investment married with a skilled labour force will lead to economic growth and subsequently the creation of employment.\nAlso, EE figures indicate the existence of “jobless growth” which is a result of the slow pace of job creation in Nigeria. Jobless growth is a term used when there is continuous macroeconomic economic growth without a corresponding growth in job creation (PwC 2018). Major cause of jobless growth in Nigeria includes lack of diversification, poor economic restructuring, poor macroeconomic policies, e.t.c.\nIt is of the essence that government look into existing employment polices to ensure greater participation of youths. Government should focus on capital expenditure in order to increase the employment intensity of the private sector especially for MSMEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJenq, Christina, Jonathan Lain, and Tara Vishwanath. 2021. “Good Jobs for a New Generation: Delivering Quality Jobs for Young Nigerians After COVID-19.” https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/511161631652256763/pdf/Good-Jobs-for-a-New-Generation-Delivering-Quality-Jobs-for-Young-Nigerians-After-COVID-19.pdf.\n\n\nOzili, Peterson K. 2020. “COVID-19 Pandemic and Economic Crisis: The Nigerian Experience and Structural Causes.” Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences 37 (4): 401–18. https://doi.org/10.1108/jeas-05-2020-0074.\n\n\nPwC. 2018. “Structural Transformation and Jobless Growth in Nigeria.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/structural-transformation-jobless-growth-Nigeria.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2020. “Impact of COVID-19 on the Supply Chain Industry.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/impact-of-covid19-the-supply-chain-industry.pdf.\n\n\nWEF. 2020. “The Future of Jobs Report 2020.” https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf."

In the adulthood (time \\(t\\)) each individual is allowed to invest, borrow, and/or lend at the market interest rate \\(R~t~\\).\n\n\nThe amount of aggregate output produced in the adulthood (time \\(t\\)), \\(Y~t~\\), is determined by the aggregate stock of physical capital at time \\(t\\) (adulthood), \\(K~t~\\), and the existing amount of efficient labor \\(N~t~\\) — where \\(N~t~\\) is the amount of efficient labor—is defined as follows:2 (Rainer and Nardini, 2007)\n\\[\nN~t = \\lambda_tH_t^P + (1-\\lambda_t)L_t^P \\tag{1.1.1}\\\\    \n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\lambda_t \\in (0,1)\\), and \\(ρ≤1\\). \\(H_t\\) and \\(L_t\\) are numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively; where \\(H_t+L_t=Z_t\\). At different stages of economic development, unskilled (skilled) workers might be relatively more abundant than skilled (unskilled) workers for aggregated production.\nFollowing Rainer and Nardini (2007), we assume that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes if \\(ρ=1\\), and perfect complements if \\(ρ=-∞\\). Notice, however, that in Acemoglu (2002), the two inputs are referred to as gross substitutes if \\(0≤ρ&lt;1\\), and as gross complements if \\(ρ&lt;1\\). Let \\(φ_t\\) be the ratio of the number of skilled workers to that of all workers \\(Z_t\\). The aggregate supply of skilled workers at time t is \\(H_t=\\phi_t Z_t\\) and that of unskilled workers is \\(L_t=(1-φ_t)Z_t\\).\nThe aggregate production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form:\n\\[\nY~t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{1.1.2}\\\\     \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\),and \\(A&gt;0\\) stands for the level of technology. The market price of the final good is normalized to 1.\nProducers can freely rent the services of capital and labor from household through competitive factors markets. Hence, they maximize their profits given the market wages per unit of skilled and unskilled labors, \\(w_t^H,w_t^L\\) and the rental price per unit of physical capital, \\(R_t\\). Solving this problem is equivalent to choosing \\(H_t, L_t,and \\:K_t\\) that maximize \\(Y_t - w^HH_t - w_t^L L_t - r_t K_t\\) subject to \\(Y~t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha}\\) .The associated equilibrium wages of skilled and unskilled labors and the equilibrium price of physical capital are given by:\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) \\lambda \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1}    \n\\]\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) (1-\\lambda) \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} \\tag{1.1.3}\\\\     \n\\]\n\\[\nq_t = \\alpha \\frac{Y_t}{K_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\((s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))\\)is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6). In other terms the maximization can take the following form:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t + d_t^ir_{t+1} -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n        s_t^i = k_t + d_t^i \\\\\n        d_t^i \\ge-\\mu k_t\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nWe replace \\(d_t^i\\) by \\((s_t^i - K_t)\\) in the above maximization, and we combine the two last constraints to obtain the following maximization problem:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[r_{t+1}+q_{t+1}[\\phi^iq_{t+1} - r_{t+1}]k_t -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i \\tag{1.2.7}\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n0 \\le k_t \\le \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu}\n\\]\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\phi^i &lt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.3}\n\\]\nno member i would invest in real capital6.In this case, \\(k_t=0\\), and each member I hold his wealth in form of debt or bonds, i.e., \\(r_{t+1}d_t^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i = c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i\\).\nThe rest of the demand functions will follow from first order conditions with respect to \\(c_{t+1}^i\\) and \\(b_{t+1}^i\\) are given below:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^i = \\frac {\\beta}{1-\\beta}R_{t+1}q_t^i  \\tag{1.2.8}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(q_t^i\\) = \\(w_t^H + (b_t^H -P_t)\\) when \\(\\eta_t^i = 1\\), and \\(q_t^i = w_t^L + b_t^L\\), when \\(\\eta_t^i = 0\\); with \\(b_t^H - P_t &gt; 0\\).\nFollowing equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.5) we obtain the savings function below:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\frac {1+\\gamma - \\beta} {1+\\gamma} [(\\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1- \\eta_t^i )w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))]  \\tag{1.2.9}\n\\]\nIn this model, investment in education depends on the endowments for educated and uneducated cohorts. In order to properly deal with issues of poverty dynamics, we assume that skilled individuals remain skilled and unskilled individuals remain unskilled. \\(b_t^H\\) indicates bequest (or transfers from skilled parents) of skilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\) for each \\(t\\), and \\(b_t^L\\) indicates bequest for unskilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=0\\) for each \\(t\\). In addition to the assumption that individuals within a cohort are homogeneous and remain as such, we also assume that:\n\\[\nb_t^H \\ge P_t &gt; b_t^L \\ge 0. \\tag{A.A.4}\n\\]\nFollowing equations (1.1.3), (1.2.8), and (1.1.1.), and assuming that \\(s_t^i&gt;0\\), we obtain that demand for education can be inferred from the choice variable for transfers from parents to offspring. Consequently, the dynamical equation for \\(b_t^H\\) and \\(b_t^L\\) are, respectively, given by:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^H = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)\\lambda \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1} + b_t^H - pY_t], \\tag{1.2.10}\\\\   \n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^L = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\lambda) \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} + b_t^L ], \\tag{1.2.11}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac {Y_{t+1}} {k_{t+1}} \\equiv \\nu\\). 7 Equation (1.2.10) is the transfer from a skilled household of generation t, whereas, equation (1.2.11) is the transfer from an unskilled household of generation \\(t\\).\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\Phi^i &gt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.5}\n\\]\nThe solution to (1.2.7) is now easy to deal with as the individual will invest as much as he can in the real capital; hence he will hold both real capital and debt in his portfolio:\n\\[\nk_t = \\frac {s_t^i} {1-\\mu} \\tag{1.2.12}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_t^i = -  \\frac {\\mu} {1-\\mu} s_t^i \\tag{1.2.13}\n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i ] \\tag{1.2.14}\n\\]\nUsing (1.2.12) and (1.2.13) in (1.2.14), we find that\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu} [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^i - \\mu r_{t+1}] \\tag{1.2.15}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1-\\eta_t^i)w_t^L + (b_t^i-\\eta_t^iP_t)\\), and $ &gt; 0$. \\(\\mu\\) is the index of the financial market development (or deepening). The last result in (1.1.15) indicates that intergenerational transfers for education purposes might depend on the level of development of financial market.\nIn the next pages we will make a simplifying assumption that \\(\\phi^L \\le (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t &lt; \\phi^H\\).\nThe link between \\(b_{t+1}^H\\) \\((b_{t+1}^L)\\) and \\(b_t^H\\) \\((b_t^L)\\) is the most important relation for intergenerational dynamics of education and poverty. In particular,\n\\[\n\\Biggl(\\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial b_{t}^H}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^L}{\\partial b_t^L}\\Biggl) &gt;0 , \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial Y_{t}} &gt;0 \\Longleftrightarrow p &lt; \\frac {(1-\\alpha)\\lambda}{N_t}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial p} &lt; 0.\n\\]\nIn the absence of credit markets for investment in education, education costs have to be covered out of savings from parents,\\(b_t^i\\), which is an intergenerational transfer (or bequest). Therefore, the regression model for investment in education is isomorphic to equation (1.2.10). In this regards, a simple formal function is derived from (1.2.10) as follows:\n\\[\ne_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1e_t + \\beta_2y_2 + \\beta_3P_t+ \\xi_i + u_i \\tag{1.2.16}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_{t+1}\\) indicates the level of education of the next generation, \\(e_t\\) indicates the level of education of the current generation (parents), \\(\\tau y_t\\) is the costs of raising a child (it uses income per capita as proxy), \\(P_t\\) is the cost of investing in human capital for one member of cohort H of generation \\(t\\), \\(\\xi _i\\) reflects household unobserved characteristics, and \\(u_i\\) is an error term."

Consequently, the dynamical equation for \\(b_t^H\\) and \\(b_t^L\\) are, respectively, given by:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^H = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)\\lambda \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1} + b_t^H - pY_t], \\tag{1.2.10}\\\\   \n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^L = \\alpha \\nu \\frac {\\beta} {1-\\beta} \\tau [(1-\\alpha)(1-\\lambda) \\frac {Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} + b_t^L ], \\tag{1.2.11}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\frac {Y_{t+1}} {k_{t+1}} \\equiv \\nu\\). 7 Equation (1.2.10) is the transfer from a skilled household of generation t, whereas, equation (1.2.11) is the transfer from an unskilled household of generation \\(t\\).\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\Phi^i &gt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.5}\n\\]\nThe solution to (1.2.7) is now easy to deal with as the individual will invest as much as he can in the real capital; hence he will hold both real capital and debt in his portfolio:\n\\[\nk_t = \\frac {s_t^i} {1-\\mu} \\tag{1.2.12}\n\\]\n\\[\nd_t^i = -  \\frac {\\mu} {1-\\mu} s_t^i \\tag{1.2.13}\n\\]\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i ] \\tag{1.2.14}\n\\]\nUsing (1.2.12) and (1.2.13) in (1.2.14), we find that\n\\[\nb_{t+i}^i = \\beta \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu} [q_{t+1} + \\Phi^i - \\mu r_{t+1}] \\tag{1.2.15}\n\\]\nwhere \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1-\\eta_t^i)w_t^L + (b_t^i-\\eta_t^iP_t)\\), and $ &gt; 0$. \\(\\mu\\) is the index of the financial market development (or deepening). The last result in (1.1.15) indicates that intergenerational transfers for education purposes might depend on the level of development of financial market.\nIn the next pages we will make a simplifying assumption that \\(\\phi^L \\le (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t &lt; \\phi^H\\).\nThe link between \\(b_{t+1}^H\\) \\((b_{t+1}^L)\\) and \\(b_t^H\\) \\((b_t^L)\\) is the most important relation for intergenerational dynamics of education and poverty. In particular,\n\\[\n\\Biggl(\\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial b_{t}^H}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^L}{\\partial b_t^L}\\Biggl) &gt;0 , \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial Y_{t}} &gt;0 \\Longleftrightarrow p &lt; \\frac {(1-\\alpha)\\lambda}{N_t}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial p} &lt; 0.\n\\]\nIn the absence of credit markets for investment in education, education costs have to be covered out of savings from parents,\\(b_t^i\\), which is an intergenerational transfer (or bequest). Therefore, the regression model for investment in education is isomorphic to equation (1.2.10). In this regards, a simple formal function is derived from (1.2.10) as follows:\n\\[\ne_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1e_t + \\beta_2y_2 + \\beta_3P_t+ \\xi_i + u_i \\tag{1.2.16}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_{t+1}\\) indicates the level of education of the next generation, \\(e_t\\) indicates the level of education of the current generation (parents), \\(\\tau y_t\\) is the costs of raising a child (it uses income per capita as proxy), \\(P_t\\) is the cost of investing in human capital for one member of cohort H of generation \\(t\\), \\(\\xi _i\\) reflects household unobserved characteristics, and \\(u_i\\) is an error term."

    "text": "We consider a closed overlapping-generations economy operating over an infinite discrete time horizon, starting with period 0. Individuals with perfect foresight invest in education and assets under capital market imperfection. However, the production of a single good occurs in a perfectly competitive environment where a single good produced can be consumed, invested, or passed on to the next generation. Population is exogenous and technology is assumed to be exogenous and stationary over time. Markets are imperfect in the sense that borrowing in the earlier periods of life for education acquisition is not possible. In particular, investment in education, which is apparently indivisible in this model, has to be financed out of savings of parents.1 In the adulthood (time \\(t\\)) each individual is allowed to invest, borrow, and/or lend at the market interest rate \\(R_t\\).\n\n\nThe amount of aggregate output produced in the adulthood (time \\(t\\)), \\(Y_t\\), is determined by the aggregate stock of physical capital at time \\(t\\) (adulthood), \\(K_t\\), and the existing amount of efficient labor \\(N_t\\) — where \\(N_t\\) is the amount of efficient labor—is defined as follows:2 (Rainer and Nardini, 2007)\n\\[\nN_t = \\lambda_tH_t^P + (1-\\lambda_t)L_t^P \\tag{1.1.1}\\\\    \n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\lambda_t \\in (0,1)\\), and \\(ρ≤1\\). \\(H_t\\) and \\(L_t\\) are numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively; where \\(H_t+L_t=Z_t\\). At different stages of economic development, unskilled (skilled) workers might be relatively more abundant than skilled (unskilled) workers for aggregated production.\nFollowing Rainer and Nardini (2007), we assume that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes if \\(ρ=1\\), and perfect complements if \\(ρ=-∞\\). Notice, however, that in Acemoglu (2002), the two inputs are referred to as gross substitutes if \\(0≤ρ&lt;1\\), and as gross complements if \\(ρ&lt;1\\). Let \\(φ_t\\) be the ratio of the number of skilled workers to that of all workers \\(Z_t\\). The aggregate supply of skilled workers at time t is \\(H_t=\\phi_t Z_t\\) and that of unskilled workers is \\(L_t=(1-φ_t)Z_t\\).\nThe aggregate production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form:\n\\[\nY_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{1.1.2}\\\\     \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\),and \\(A&gt;0\\) stands for the level of technology. The market price of the final good is normalized to 1.\nProducers can freely rent the services of capital and labor from household through competitive factors markets. Hence, they maximize their profits given the market wages per unit of skilled and unskilled labors, \\(w_t^H,w_t^L\\) and the rental price per unit of physical capital, \\(R_t\\). Solving this problem is equivalent to choosing \\(H_t\\), \\(L_t\\), and \\(\\:K_t\\) that maximize \\(Y_t - w^HH_t - w_t^L L_t - r_t K_t\\) subject to \\(Y_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha}\\) . The associated equilibrium wages of skilled and unskilled labors and the equilibrium price of physical capital are given by:\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) \\lambda \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1}    \n\\]\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) (1-\\lambda) \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} \\tag{1.1.3}\\\\     \n\\]\n\\[\nq_t = \\alpha \\frac{Y_t}{K_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6).

    "text": "A new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6). In other terms the maximization can take the following form:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t + d_t^ir_{t+1} -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n        s_t^i = k_t + d_t^i \\\\\n        d_t^i \\ge-\\mu k_t\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nWe replace \\(d_t^i\\) by \\((s_t^i - K_t)\\) in the above maximization, and we combine the two last constraints to obtain the following maximization problem:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[r_{t+1}+q_{t+1}[\\phi^iq_{t+1} - r_{t+1}]k_t -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i \\tag{1.2.7}\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n0 \\le k_t \\le \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu}\n\\]\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\phi^i &lt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.3}\n\\]\nno member i would invest in real capital6.In this case, \\(k_t=0\\), and each member I hold his wealth in form of debt or bonds, i.e., \\(r_{t+1}d_t^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i = c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i\\).\nThe rest of the demand functions will follow from first order conditions with respect to \\(c_{t+1}^i\\) and \\(b_{t+1}^i\\) are given below:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^i = \\frac {\\beta}{1-\\beta}R_{t+1}q_t^i  \\tag{1.2.8}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(q_t^i\\) = \\(w_t^H + (b_t^H -P_t)\\) when \\(\\eta_t^i = 1\\), and \\(q_t^i = w_t^L + b_t^L\\), when \\(\\eta_t^i = 0\\); with \\(b_t^H - P_t &gt; 0\\).\nFollowing equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.5) we obtain the savings function below:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\frac {1+\\gamma - \\beta} {1+\\gamma} [(\\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1- \\eta_t^i )w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))]  \\tag{1.2.9}\n\\]\nIn this model, investment in education depends on the endowments for educated and uneducated cohorts. In order to properly deal with issues of poverty dynamics, we assume that skilled individuals remain skilled and unskilled individuals remain unskilled. \\(b_t^H\\) indicates bequest (or transfers from skilled parents) of skilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\) for each \\(t\\), and \\(b_t^L\\) indicates bequest for unskilled individuals, i.e., \\(\\eta_t^i=0\\) for each \\(t\\). In addition to the assumption that individuals within a cohort are homogeneous and remain as such, we also assume that:\n\\[\nb_t^H \\ge P_t &gt; b_t^L \\ge 0. \\tag{A.A.4}\n\\]\nFollowing equations (1.1.3), (1.2.8), and (1.1.1.), and assuming that \\(s_t^i&gt;0\\), we obtain that demand for education can be inferred from the choice variable for transfers from parents to offspring.

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill. The model suggests that strategies aimed at growth of entrepreneurship and wages must distinguish between existing and potential entrepreneurs. For existing entrepreneurs reinvesting wages, a program of skill upgrade is more potent than supply of low price capital; the former leads to higher wages while the latter perpetuates low wages. For enterprises generating below- subsistence wages, a strict targeting program of low-cost capital is appropriate. For potential entrepreneurs, efforts should seek to combine skill development with frameworks to match new skills to commensurate capital. A public-private partnership could achieve this goal without burdening the private sector while simultaneously eliminating inefficiencies associated with public lending programs."

An enterprise is created by matching capital with worker’s skill. We assume that the size of a unit of capital corresponds to the level of technology. For example, a low-tech enterprise requires a small size of capital and a high-tech enterprise requires a large size of capital. The enterprise creation process that we imagine is such that a low-tech enterprise can be created by workers with low, medium or high skills if they are matched with a small size of capital but a low-skill worker cannot create a medium or high-tech enterprise. In terms of productivity and wages, a high skill worker may produce more than a low-skill worker in a low-tech enterprise, but his productivity will be lower in a low-tech enterprise than in a medium or high-tech enterprise.7 In addition to skill, an individual is endowed with initial asset a and can choose to either work for a wage or to run an enterprise. An individual in wage employment earns a market wage \\(w^m\\) that depends on his skill and a return on his asset of \\(r^m\\)a where \\(r^m\\) is the market interest rate. A worker who chooses to run an enterprise must devote his entire labor endowment to it. The difference between capital invested in the enterprise and the individual’s asset is borrowed from the capital market at the borrowing rate.\nWe focus on one-person enterprises where output is determined by the production function\n\\[\ny = f(s, k; \\theta)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich utilizes the worker’s observable skill s, physical capital k, where \\(k \\geq a\\) and unobservable worker’s ability captured by \\(\\theta\\). The production function is in all respects an individual version of the standard production function but in addition reflects the dimensions of human capital that are emphasize entrepreneurship literature. The human capital literature recognizes the potential correlation that exists between measurable skills and unmeasured ability (Bedard 2001). while the entrepreneurship literature emphasizes the importance of unmeasured ability in productivity (Evans and Jovanovic 1989).8\nThe entrepreneur’s labor is a fixed input while skill and capital are the variable inputs. In order to emphasize the matching of skill and capital while focusing on productivity of the match, we express the production technology as a function of skill-adjusted capital\n\\[\ny=f((s,k):\\theta)=f\\left(\\left(1,\\frac{k}{s}\\right):\\theta\\right)=f\\left(\\left(\\frac{k}{s}:\\theta \\right)\\right)=f(k:\\theta)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(k=\\frac{k}{s}\\) represents skill-adjusted input and \\(\\theta=\\theta(s)\\) is a shift parameter that depends on skill and has the property \\(\\theta'(s)&gt;0.\\) In essence, an enterprise is defined by a level of skill-adjusted capital. Equation 2 accounts for two properties of the model. First, an increase in n, conditional on unmeasured ability corresponds to an increase in the quantity of capital given the level of skill. Due to complimentarity between capital and skills as in standard production technologies, an increase in n will yield an increase output but a decrease in marginal output. Second, an increase in the level of skill, for example by replacing the worker with a more skilled worker, will lead to a decrease in n but shift the production function upward through the parameter \\(\\theta\\). The reason is that an increase in observable measure of human capital is associated with an upward shift in the unobserved measure of human capital. In order to reflect these properties, we make the following assumptions:\na) \\(f(k:\\theta)\\) is increasing and concave in \\(k:f_k&gt;0\\) and \\(f_{kk}&lt;0;\\)\nb) Output and marginal returns to adjusted capital both increase by unmeasured ability, that is,\n\\(f_\\theta &gt;0; f_{\\theta k}&gt;0;\\)\nc) The Inada conditions hold: \\(lim_{{k\\to0}} f_k =\\infty\\) and \\(lim_{{k\\to\\infty}} f_k=0.\\)\nThe variable inputs receive their marginal products while enterprise profits are paid to labor as wages.9 Capital is paid its rent and skill is paid its marginal product which is equivalent to the cost of skill acquisition. In general, the cost of skill is interpreted in terms of the cost of effort in learning the use of capital. Because the cost is small when skill is high relative to capital and is large when skill is low compared to capital, the cost of skill increases with the level of skill adjusted capital. We suppress \\(\\theta\\) in the meantime and define rent and wages respectively as\n\\[\nr(k)=f_k;w(k)=f(k)-kf_k-c(k)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwhere \\(c(k)\\) is the price of skill and \\(c'(k)&gt;0.\\) The output and earnings functions are shown in Figure 7 where each point on the horizontal axis represents an enterprise. Conditional on entrepreneur’s skill, output increases as increasing levels of capital are matched with the given skill until adjusted capital reaches \\(\\overline{k}\\) , the point after which additional capital yields no increase in output. Return to capital, or rent, is the slope of the production function. From the Inada conditions, the slope is infinitely large at low levels and decreases with the level of skill-adjusted capital. We define a threshold \\(\\underline{k}\\) as the minimum level of skill-adjusted capital for an enterpriseto be viable. For values of \\(k\\le{\\underline{k}},\\) the worker earns a negative wage due to a combination of low output and high rent. The price of skill is very low at this stage because the level of skill is high relative to capital. Nonetheless, there will be no activity in that interval because workers will have to pay rent by selling off other assets.10 The price of skill rises slowly, rent continues to fall and wages begin to rise gradually over the interval \\(\\underline{k}\\le{k}\\le{\\overline{k}}.\\) Irrespective of the amount of capital, a worker with a given level of skill can achieve output that is no more than \\(f(\\overline{k})\\) in the absence of skill upgrade. For values \\(k&gt;\\overline{k},\\) output remains nearly flat due to concavity of the production function and rent stays flat (near zero) as well but the cost of skill rises as skill levels relative to capital are falling. This leads to decrease in wages as we move beyond the point \\(\\overline{k}.\\) Therefore, the entrepreneur’s wage is maximized at \\(\\overline{k}.\\) We designate \\(\\overline{k}\\) as the efficient level of adjusted capital input, the level at which capital is commensurate with skill.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Output, Interest and Wages.\n\n\nWe demonstrate in in Figure 8 the effect of skill upgrade from \\(s\\) to \\(s'\\) reflected by a shift in the parameter \\(\\theta.\\) Given capital, skill upgrade shifts the output and rent curves upward but the extent of the shift increases with \\(k\\) in line with assumption b) above. The shift produces two effects. First, the point at which wages become positive shifts to the left reflecting the increase in productivity of skill. However, the shift at this end is small because output increases only by a little while rent also increases by a little; the net effect on \\(\\underline{k}\\) may be negligible. Second, the efficient level of adjusted capital shifts to the right in reflection of increased capacity of the worker to utilize a larger quantity of capital given the shift in unmeasured ability. In effect, the feasible range \\([\\underline{k},\\overline{k}]\\) widens with skill upgrade. However, because the skill cost function depends only on adjusted capital and not on output, it remains unchanged after the skill upgrade; the cost of skill only depends on the relative level of skill and capital along the horizontal axis. Thus the difference between the shift in output and the shift in rent widens as \\(k\\) increases, causing an increasing shift in the wage function. Consider an enterprise with initial adjusted capital of \\(k_0\\) that experienced a skill upgrade. Although adjusted capital decreases nominally from \\(k_0\\) to \\(k_1\\), wage increases from \\(w(k_0)\\) to \\(w(k_1)\\). It is also plausible from the rent graph that \\(r(k_1)&gt;r(k_0)\\) In general, an increase in wage is accompanied by increase in rent when driven by skill upgrade (represented by the upward shift in the rent curve) , but is accompanied by a decrease in rent when it is driven by capital upgrade (represented by moving to the right on the horizontal axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Effect of Skill Upgrade.\n\n\nWe examine in Figure 9 the potential wage trajectory of enterprises with efficient levels of adjusted capital to demonstrate the implication of the earnings and cost structure for enterprise profitability. The vertical axis represents capital while the horizontal axis represents skill. We use the 45 degrees line to represent wage outcomes of optimal matches between skill and capital where skill and capital are commensurate. Because skill and capital are typically measured in very different units and scales which we do not attempt to reconcile, the 45 degrees line reflects \\(commensurability\\) instead of \\(equality\\) of skill and capital. In essence, skill upgrade is matched by corresponding increase in capital as we move along the line so that wages earned by optimal matches increase along the line. Figure 8 is connected to Figure 9 in the sense that an enterprise with \\(k&gt;\\overline{k}\\) lies above the 45 degrees line while an enterprise with \\(k&lt;\\overline{k}\\) lies below the line.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Enterprise Wage Trajectory.\n\n\nThe broken vertical line at \\(s=s_0\\) represents the locus of initial adjusted capital of an enterprise. Consider an enterprise that starts with \\(k_a\\) where the capital is less than commensurate with skill (this translates to a very small value of \\(k\\) in Figure 8. At that level, output is low, the price of skill is low but rent is high, yielding a very low wage. An enterprise that begins at this point will find the cost of capital prohibitive and is unlikely to invest in capital. Because the cost of skill is low, the enterprise may choose to invest in more skills. But the enterprise will not benefit from such investment as it will not raise wages meaningfully: adjusted capital will decrease and rent will increase. The high rate of rent will eat away any increase in output achieved by raising the level of skill. In the absence of any investment, the high rent will drive enterprise wages westward until reaching the point a on the 45 degrees line.\nIt is interesting to note that equilibrium wage for the enterprise that started at \\(k_a\\) is exactly the wage that would be earned by an individual with skill \\(s_a\\) that is provided with capital that is just efficient for the worker, which results in adjusted capital of \\(\\overline{k}_a\\). Therefore an individual entrepreneur with skill \\(s_0\\) will earn the same wage as an individual with skill \\(s_a&lt;s_0\\). An enterprise that begins with \\(k_b\\) will face a similar experience. Consider an enterprise that begins at \\(k_c.\\) In that region, rent and cost of skill are both moderate but rent is falling while the cost of skill is rising. In the absence of any upgrade, or considering increase in skills only, enterprise wage will reach equilibrium at point \\(c\\) on the trajectory. However, additional investment in capital only, such as through reinvestment of wages, will lead enterprise wage northward until it reaches \\(w(\\overline{k}_0)\\). Intuitively, additional capital is being added to a production process that is utilizing relatively high entrepreneurial skill. As a result, wages rise until it reaches the efficient level. However, additional investment in both capital and skills, with more on the capital side (maybe through wage reinvestment) to take advantage of falling rent, will raise wages and lead the enterprise to point \\(d\\) on the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_d\\) faces similar situation as one that starts at \\(k_C\\) with the difference that it has to invest more in skill than capital. Because of rising cost of skills, wages will initially fall as the entrepreneur invests in more skill until the enterprise latches onto the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_e\\) has very low skill compared to capital and faces prohibitive cost of skill but very low cost of capital. In the absence of skill upgrade due to the high cost, wages will fall and the enterprise will shrink in terms of capital until it reaches the size of an enterprise that started at \\(k_d\\) when it can begin investing in skill because skill costs are now moderate. Thus, an enterprise that started out with much larger capital than skill will shrink at first before it can grow.\nEvery enterprise will reach an equilibrium that is represented by a point on the 45 degree line. Given that entrepreneurs reinvest wages net of consumption in practice, an enterprise moves vertically north of its old equilibrium because capital increases through wage reinvestment while skill remains unchanged. In the absence of a matching skill upgrade, wages will fall and the firm will be back to its old equilibrium 11.However, investment in additional skills will move the reinvesting enterprise eastward and therefore move to another point on the 45 degree line.\nEnterprise stability depends on two conditions. First, equilibrium wage must exceed a threshold level: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w_0\\) where \\(w_0\\ge0\\) is a floor wage12. for example \\(w(\\overline{k}_b)&lt;w_0\\) implies that enterprises at point \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Figure 9 are unstable. Second, equilibrium wage must be not less than the starting efficient wage: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w(\\overline{k})^0\\) where \\(w(\\overline{k})^0\\) is is the wage that should have been earned if the initial match was efficient given the worker’s skill. This condition implies that an enterprise at point \\(c\\) is also unstable. Combining the two conditions, the stability condition is\n\\[\nw(\\overline{k})^0 \\le w(\\overline{k})^0 \\ge w_0.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 4 implies that an enterprise is stable only if the capital-skill “gap” is within a small neighborhood where rent and the cost of skill upgrade are both small. This is intuitively the goal of credit assessment prior to lending. While lenders are unlikely to create the exact efficient match \\(k=\\overline{k}\\), they endeavor to create matches within a neighborhood \\(k \\in (\\overline{k} -\\delta, \\overline{k} +\\delta)\\) that satisfies condition (4)."

    "section": "3.1 Structure of Enterprise Sector",
    "text": "3.1 Structure of Enterprise Sector\nThe enterprise sector comprises entities where entrepreneurs employ their endowed assets without borrowing as well as entities created through borrowing. For enterprises financed solely by endowed assets, given the possibility of borrowing to ease credit constraints, it must be the case that \\(\\alpha = \\overline{k}.\\) It is therefore safe to assume that self-financed enterprises are positioned along the \\(w(\\overline{k})\\) trajectory depending on the equilibrium wage determined by the match between endowed assets and skills15. The assumption is not implausible for the following reason. The framework implies that such enterprises cannot grow by merely adding capital because adjusted capital is at the efficient level. That is, profit reinvestment only, without skill upgrade, will not lead to increase in wages. This implication is compatible with evidence from various studies of self employment suggesting that entrepreneurship skills are the most important constraint to small business growth (Yahya et al. 2011).\nEnterprises created through borrowing face entirely different dynamics. In general the worker and the lender must have incentives to create an enterprise. Given the opportunity cost of capital of \\(r^m\\) and alternative wages of \\(w^m\\), the joint surplus of the worker and the lender in creating the enterprise is given by\n\\[\nV(k) = [w(k)-w^m -r^ma][r(k)-r^m]\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe first term on the right side is the worker’s surplus which is the difference between enterprise wage and the opportunity cost: alternate wages and forgone income from endowed assets.\nSimilarly, the second term is the lender’s surplus which is the excess of rent over the opportunity cost of capital. An enterprise will be created if and only if the worker and the lender earn positive surpluses. Indeed, creation of an enterprise is subject to the existence constraint\n\\[\nV(k) \\ge V_0(w_0,r_0)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(w_0\\) is a floor wage and \\(r_0\\) is a floor return required by lenders. We now investigate how changes in the exogenous variables affect both the size and the structure of the enterprise sector.\nConsider an increase in interest rates \\(r^m\\). Lenders’ surplus decrease as the opportunity cost of capital increases. As a result, lenders must ration capital by pursuing either of two options. One, they can reduce the amount of capital offered to all intending entrepreneurs. But this option will lead to a general decrease in wages so that more enterprises would violate the stability constraint (4). Second, they can exclude lending to low-tech enterprises that would not satisfy the existence constraint following the increase in interest rate. The resultant upward shift in skills leads to increases in both wages and rent. This shift is illustrated in Figure 11 . Supply of capital falls on the lender’s side of the market and causes the enterprise labor demand curve to shift to the left. At the same time, an increase in interest rate reduces the worker’s surplus through increase in return on endowed asset. In response, workers with low skills who are unable to generate the required return will exit the enterprise sector causing the supply curve to shift to the left, causing a decrease in the quantity of labor and increase in average skills. Skill-adjusted capital reduces nominally but the production function shifts upward as presented in Figure 8. Because the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, adjusted capital decreases and wage increases in comparison to the initial equilibrium. In effect, rising interest rates squeeze out low-skill-low-tech enterprises because they are unable to generate positive surpluses at prevailing costs. On the other hand, a decrease in interest rates pushes the demand and supply curves to the right, resulting in higher skill-adjusted capital, large number of low-skill-low-tech enterprises, and lower wages in equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Increase in Interest rate r\n\n\nAn increase in alternate wage \\(w^m\\) reduces only the worker’s side of the surplus function, and workers with low entrepreneurial skills will exit from the enterprise sector, leading the enterprise labor supply curve to shift to the left while the demand curve remains unchanged. As shown in Figure 12, skill-adjusted capital falls and equilibrium wage rises. On the other hand, a decrease in \\(w^m\\) raises the workers’ surplus and attracts more workers into entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Increase in Alternate Wages w\n\n\nAverage skills decrease, and skill-adjusted capital increases, leading to lower equilibrium wages. Thus, an increase in interest rates or alternate wages has the effects of raising average skills and wages in the enterprise sector. This is consistent with the stylized facts: co-movement of interest rates and wages, and co-movement of wages across sectors. But the extent of wage increase and changes in adjusted capital depend on whether the change is driven by wages or interest rates. Changes in relative enterprise wages (ratio of enterprise wages to alternate wages) depends on the ease of entry into the enterprise sector, which depends on the ease of finding capital. If credit markets are well developed so that entry and exit from self employment is unconstrained, then relative enterprise wages will fall and rise faster than in societies with less developed credit markets."

    "text": "4.1 Skill and Capital Mobility\nIn general, there are skill overlaps between the sectors. Workers at the high end of the agricultural sector skill distribution are comparable to workers in the enterprise sector.16 Similarly, some workers at the high end of the enterprise sector skill distribution are those who could be in the formal wage sector but voluntarily choose the entrepreneurship sector. Given the impracticality of direct transition from the agricultural sector to the formal wage sector for many workers, inter-sectoral mobility assumes the form of a step-like or “ladder” function.17 We assume a fixed-capital economy with mobility of capital and labor across sectors. Increase in agricultural or urban formal wage draws workers away from the enterprise sector while a decrease has the reverse effect. Whenever workers are drawn away from enterprise sector, the workers left behind are selectively more productive. It is plausible to assume that individuals with higher entrepreneurial skills are less likely to leave the enterprise sector."

    "section": "4.2 General Equilibrium Dynamics",
    "text": "4.2 General Equilibrium Dynamics\nConsider the impact of growth in the formal wage sector. Given the supply of skills, the labor demand curve shifts to the right and wages and employment both increase. This leads to increase in alternate wages, which will reduce employment in the enterprise sector. Individuals with high skill but end up at points a, b and c in Figure 9 will be the first set to exit the sector due to underemployment of their skills. Although some low-tech enterprises might remain because some low-skill workers could remain, enterprise wages will nevertheless increase. The increase in enterprise wages might attract agricultural workers with above-average skills, especially in cases where agriculture is predominantly peasant and small-scale, leading to a decrease in average skills and reduction in agricultural wages.\nAn increase in agricultural wage, driven by technological change or improvement in climatic conditions, raises alternate wages for workers at the bottom of skill distribution in the enterprise sector. Low-skill workers in low-tech enterprises will exit the enterprise sector for the agricultural sector, leading to higher wages, higher skills and lower employment in the enterprise sector. The impact on the formal sector would at best be minimal. While some workers may move directly from the formal wage sector into agriculture, the increase in enterprise wages may also attract comparable workers from the formal sector. The net effect on the formal wage sector depends on the part of the skill distribution that workers exit from.\nA strategy of reducing the cost of enterprise capital increases the surplus on the workers’ side of the joint surplus function. Workers move out of the agricultural and formal wage employments into entrepreneurship, shifting the entrepreneurship labor supply curve to the right. However, the effect on the lenders’ side depends on whether the program is a private or a public sector initiative. If private lenders reduce their interest rates but continue to appraise loans on the basis of productivity, they are likely to remain selective in terms of enterprise skills in order to reduce the risks of default. The reduction of lending rate is reflected in a movement along the demand curve. Conditional on supply adjustment, enterprise wages will decrease and skill adjusted capital will increase as in Figure 13. On the other hand, if the lending policy is driven by public policy, the outcome will be as if interest rates are reduced exogenously, which also leads to lower wages and higher skill-adjusted capital. However, for identical reduction in interest rate, the difference lies in the degree to which the skill composition of the sector changes, which can be deduced by comparing Figure 13 (drawn to yield identical reduction in interest rate) and a reversal of Figure 11. Notice that, in equilibrium, the increase in adjusted capital (decrease in overall level of skill) is very large in the case of public policy and very small in the case where private lenders cut lending rates. That is, the selective mechanism of private lenders that accompany reduction of lending rates allows minor reductions in enterprise productivity while the skill blind process that accompanies public low-interest capital schemes largely undermine productivity.\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Low interest lending from private sector.\n\n\nSuppose instead that vocational or entrepreneurial skill is upgraded. That is, instead of quantitative increase in labor supply we have a qualitative increase in entrepreneurial skills, which shifts the supply curve to the left. In this case, adjusted capital will fall (capital-skill gap will close) and wages will rise. Thus, skill upgrade is more potent than low-cost capital for poverty reduction. Stagnation in production processes with more credit supply has generated increased employment in the enterprise sector but has not made a significant dent on poverty rates. Low-productivity activities are easy to replicate and they generate low returns when matched with low cost capital. Studies relating to Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises show that lack of skills, rather than lack of capital, are responsible for the slow growth of the sector.\nHowever, the policy of skill upgrade alone must be directed toward those already engaged in entrepreneurship and are reinvesting wages. Suppose that unemployed workers, those outside entrepreneurship, are provided with additional skills. In the absence of deliberate efforts to expand access to enterprise capital (not by cutting lending rates), these workers will become job seekers in the formal sector rather than becoming entrepreneurs. Considering the wage profile where the formal sector offers the highest returns, these newly trained workers would simply join the pool of unemployed workers seeking formal employment."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAlthough many factors have been advanced for expansion of self‐employment, the government initiatives were undoubtedly central. In order to combat high unemployment that persisted into the late 1970s, the British government under Margaret Thatcher created several initiatives aimed at supporting self‐employment beginning from 1981. These initiatives include the Enterprise Allowance Scheme which provided guaranteed income of GBP40 per week to unemployed people that set up an enterprise, the Loan Guarantee Scheme through which the government provided the security that lenders usually require in order to facilitate lending to viable small businesses that may lack access to finance, and the Business Expansion Scheme that aimed to provide investment opportunities for investors↩︎\nThese efforts came in many forms. There were pressures on lending institutions to reduce interest rates, leading to development of enterprise finance initiatives by commercial banks and other financial institutions. Some assistance also came in the form of credit guarantees. These efforts drew a large number among the unemployed workers into entrepreneurship.↩︎\nGovernments in Africa and other developing countries implemented low‐cost capital schemes during 1970s and early 1980 and the outcomes were self‐defeating. Earnings plunged, default rates rose and poverty rates arising from very low wages skyrocketed. The self‐defeating growth of higher employment and lower wages following increased supply of low‐cost capital could be attributed to several factors. First, an exogenous decrease in the cost of capital will result in lower average skills and therefore reduce enterprise productivity. Output produced by low‐ tech enterprises is typically non‐tradable and only subject to demand for domestic consumption. In countries where imported goods are favored over domestic products due to either preferences or quality issues, low‐tech enterprise output growth is associated with product glut and low prices. Second, other than capital requirement, there is free‐entry into the sector and low‐tech production systems can easily be replicated. Free entry ensures that output prices and therefore earnings are driven to razor‐thin competitive levels. The absence of institutional barriers and coordination failures make price regulations impossible. Third, an increased supply of capital that is not driven by skills will have different implications than supply shift that is driven by skills. Increased supply of capital that is driven by skill upgrade moves the enterprise sector toward more productive enterprises and leads to higher wages. On the other hand, an increase in the supply of capital without efficient matching leads to lower wages and reduction in enterprise efficiency levels.↩︎\nExpectation of positive selection on ability into wage employment in non‐competitive labor markets is based on the assumption that individuals with high ability are likely to be selected by employers. In non‐clearing markets, employers subject job candidates to series of tests – written, oral and situation‐room types of experiences – in order to select the most able candidates. Because these opportunities are limited, individuals with the highest abilities are often drawn into wage employment at least for the first few years of their careers. However, the sample of workers who seek wage employment may not be representative of the labor force. Indeed, if individuals with the highest levels of ability choose not to seek wage employment, then positive selection on ability into wage employment among job‐seekers will not translate into positive selection on ability for the entire labor force.↩︎\nA loan guarantee reduces the cost of capital in two ways. First, it eliminates the transactions cost component of lending rates. Second, it eliminates the opportunity cost associated with forgone earnings from assets that would otherwise be pledged as collateral.↩︎\nThe deficit of attention to skill and capital matching is not surprising. It is always assumed, and taken for granted, that the credit market is capable of creating efficient matches between capital and skill in the formation of enterprises. But there are noteworthy grounds to believe that this is not always the case. The practice in the credit market to screen borrowers on the basis of perception of information asymmetry rather than on the basis of borrowers’ productivity implies that high productivity individuals lacking collateral may be denied access to entrepreneurship capital.↩︎\nCompare a high school dropout with a Masters’ of Science in civil engineering. Both of them can fry plantains but the dropout cannot supervise road construction. Meanwhile, it is possible that the M.Sc. will fry more plantains in a unit of time than the dropout. In an economy endowed by capital for frying plantains, everyone would fry plantain. On the other hand, if capital is only available for road construction, then the engineers are employed while the dropouts are unemployed. If capital is only available for road construction in an economy populated by high school dropouts, then no construction enterprise is created and nobody is employed.↩︎\nAn individual’s education or skill is positively correlated with his unmeasured ability. It is implausible that the level of education an individual attains alone summarizes all the productive skills that may be productive in entrepreneurship, neither is it plausible to assume that innate ability alone summarizes them. Existence of complementarities between observed education and unobserved ability is arguably plausible.↩︎\nThis is consistent with the practice where the profits of the enterprise are considered as earnings of the entrepreneur. The only difference is that we separate returns to labor from returns to skill in the model.↩︎\nThis corresponds to an extremely high rate of underutilization (or underemployment) of worker skills.↩︎\nThe conditions under which an enterprise remains in equilibrium are discussed in details in Appendix A.↩︎\nThe wage floor increases with the cost of capital and alternate wages.↩︎\nIntuitively, rising wages indicate higher returns in the sector, and attracts more workers and lenders as long as rent exceeds the cost of capital. This leads to increase in capital supplied to the sector, and consequently, decrease in rent.↩︎\nDetails of the derivation are provided in Appendix B.↩︎\nThe literature on intergenerational wealth transfer has examined the possibility that individuals who receive large bequeaths are also likely to come from households endowed with high entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, we expect to observe a strong correlation between enterprise skill and endowed asset in a cross‐section of entrepreneurs.↩︎\nBoth sets of workers are likely to have had some formal education and vocational or apprenticeship training.↩︎\nFor example, unskilled workers from the rural area that arrive in the urban center in search of formal sector jobs must enroll in appropriate skill development program or course of study that may take some time to complete. In the meantime, such workers will engage in activities in the entrepreneurship sector or otherwise remain unemployed while attending school. It is on this basis that the model reconciles with the previous models that describe the enterprise sector as a transit sector.↩︎\nA reading of Yunus (2003) shows that early microcredit was targeted at workers with observable productivity. One of the weaknesses inherent in subsequent microfinance practice is that loans are often targeted at workers with latent productivity. The non‐observability of productivity for many of the clients and the lack of sensitivity of loan amounts to productivity introduced important imperfections in the capital‐skill matching process in microcredit schemes.↩︎"

    "text": "This paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill.

    "text": "This paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill. The model suggests that strategies aimed at growth of entrepreneurship and wages must distinguish between existing and potential entrepreneurs. For existing entrepreneurs reinvesting wages, a program of skill upgrade is more potent than supply of low price capital; the former leads to higher wages while the latter perpetuates low wages.

    "section": "",
    "text": "President Jonathan seems to realize that good governance and service delivery matters most at the local council levels. He also seems to understand the constraints to performance at that level and is willing to tackle them. A noble attempt made in pursuit of this goal was a proposed constitutional amendment in August 2011 to scrap the special state-local council joint account with a view to granting the local councils financial autonomy. Under the present arrangement, allocations to local councils are deposited into the special account. Unfortunately, those accounts are controlled by the state governors and local councils are funded at their discretions. The perennial abuse of the system must have prompted the president to propose the amendment. However, the proposal met with a staunch opposition from the state governors, and the president did little to push the issue further.\nIn the matters of governance and development, the local council is the place where the rubber meets the road. The set of activities that fall within the purview of local councils are the building blocks of all indices of good governance, economic growth and human development. According to the 1999 constitution, which is currently in force, local councils are responsible for primary, adult and vocational education, health services, agriculture and natural resource development. More importantly, the local council is the level of government that is most accessible and can be most accountable to the citizens. Poor villagers who cannot afford the cost of transportation to state capitals or the national capital can walk to their local councils to make their voices heard and demand accountability for service provisions.\nLocal councils are treated as cash cows by state governors and political party “kingmakers” rather than development centers that they are designed to be. Local council chairmen are typically nominated by their parties, whose de-facto leaders are the state governors, and supported financially by kingmakers who expect to be paid back. This gives room for resource leakages and other forms of abuse of public treasury in the sense that funds meant for basic services are diverted for personal uses.\nThe consequences of abuse of the joint-account framework over the years are devastating. Nigeria is ranked among the 16 countries with the highest infant mortality rate in the world1 and its adult literacy rate stands at only 61 percent. Public primary education has been starved of funds and is being attended by only the poor who cannot afford private school. With around 70 percent poverty rate, the majority of children are given poor quality of education. A poor quality of basic primary education is a poor foundation for higher learning. Little wonder then that the country is faced with graduates of higher institutions who are lacking in productive skills. It is not surprising that we are faced with youth unemployment of alarming proportion. In order to turn this situation around, the President and the national assembly must find ways to grant financial autonomy to local councils to ensure that they have the funds to provide the infrastructure required in their schools and hospitals, and pay their teachers and hospital staff in time.\nIt is a welcome development that the national assembly is considering a revision of the 1999 constitution. Good enough, local council reforms have been included in the agenda. However, the existing constitution has provided the structures for good governance, but they are in very weak positions. The focus of this constitutional review, as far as local government is concerned, should be granting financial autonomy to local councils and strengthening the system to ensure proper oversight over the council chairmen. Responsible authorities, including the electoral bodies, need to convince and assure citizens that their rights to recall elected officials are guaranteed and the process is seen to be transparent by all at all times.\nIt is not clear that average Nigerians care so much about how many years a president or a governor spends in office and whether they run for one term or three. It is not even clear that they care about how long a local council chairman is in office. What they care about is a local government system that is accountable and effective in delivering services. The pervasive focus of governance reforms on federal and state governments obviously has very little or nothing to do with the quality of governance at the local level where it really matters."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Harris and Todaro (1970) model of urban unemployment remains one of the historically insightful tools for analyzing urban unemployment problems in less developed countries (LDCs): a politically determined urban minimum wage set above rural agricultural wage draws rural workers into urban unemployment. Unfortunately, the urban informal sector that has become the largest employer of labor in the recent history of developing countries and its dynamics were largely underdeveloped at the time that the model was written. It is therefore not surprising that recent tests of the relationship between minimum wage and urban unemployment in different developing country settings demonstrate a failing of the model’s prediction. In this paper, I make two main extensions to the model: I include an urban informal flexible-wage sector and allow for both rural-urban and urban-rural migration; and link rural wage to the size of rural labor. The urban sector is divided into the formal and the informal segments by the minimum wage and urban unemployment is driven by both rural-urban migrants and urban non-migrants. These extensions to the model yield three new insights: (1) an increase in minimum wage is not a precondition for rural-urban migration, (2) urban unemployment is driven largely by wage comparisons between the urban formal and informal sectors, and (3) urban unemployment is largely voluntary. The implication of the model is straightforward: the best strategy to reduce urban unemployment is to develop the urban informal sector. I discuss some policy choices."

    "section": "3.2 Expected Wages",
    "text": "3.2 Expected Wages\nRural agricultural wage denoted \\(W_R\\) represents the average or “shared” product in agriculture. Urban formal and informal wages given by \\(W_F\\) and \\(W_l\\) respectively are valued in terms of marginal product. If the marginal product of an urban formal worker falls below the minimum wage, the firm subcontracts the work to the informal sector. The main assumption is that, \\(W_F \\ge\\) \\(\\overline{W}_M \\ge\\) \\(W_l\\) where \\(\\overline{W}_M\\) is the minimum wage.\nI distinguish between the urban wage that enters the decision process of a rural worker who is considering urban migration and the urban wage that is taken into consideration by an individual who is unemployed in the city. A rural worker considering migration estimates an expected urban wage using the distribution of urban employment. Urban expected wage is given by the expression\n\\[W^e_U = \\frac{N_F}{N_U}W_F + \\frac{N_I}{N_U}W_I \\tag{4}\\]\nThe presence of the informal sector in (4) diminishes the effect of the minimum wage on migration. For simplicity assume that there is no excess demand for labor in the formal sector so that \\(W_F = \\overline{W}_M\\)Then equation (4) implies that \\(W^E_U = \\frac{N_F}{N_U}\\overline{W}_M + \\frac{N_I}{N_U}W_I\\) As the share of formal sector in urban labor market \\(\\left(\\frac{N_F}{N_U}\\right)\\) diminishes, urban expected wage approximates informal sector wage and the role of the minimum wage fizzles in migration decision. This is particularly important in developing countries where an estimated 80 to 85 percent of urban employment is generated in the informal sector. Macharia (2003, 1) captures this idea by noting that\n.. with the proliferation of the informal economy in the 1980s and 1990s, migrants who were entrepreneurial still had hopes in the urban areas. This was so, mainly because of the expectations of higher numbers of people who would become consumers of products they hoped to make and sell in the urban areas. Thus, it is not simply the “hope for employment in the urban areas that pulls people to the urban areas but also the hope of venturing in an economic activity in the informal sector!\nIndeed, from equation (4), sufficiently (high) low earnings in the informal sector or high rates of urban unemployment are (incentives) disincentives for rural-urban migration as they drive urban expected wage (upward) downward. This is the case even when the urban minimum wage is unchanged. However, rural-urban migration could continue unabated as rural population pressure depresses the rural wage further below the urban informal wage.\nThere is another kind of expected wage that enters the decision of the urban unemployed worker who is contemplating whether to remain in the city of return to the rural sector. Once a worker is in the city, the distribution of urban employment does not matter for evaluation of urban wages. To the worker, expected (weighted average) urban wage is given by18\n\\[W^\\alpha_U = \\alpha W_F + (1 - \\alpha)W_I \\tag{5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the formal sector share of urban employment or the probability that the urban employed worker is in the formal sector. Notice that the coefficients in equation (4) are the shares of urban total labor while the coefficients in equation (5) are the shares of urban employment. In the presence of urban unemployment, the latter shares are larger than the former, yielding \\(W^\\alpha_U &gt; W^e_U\\) ."

    "section": "3.3 Equilibrium",
    "text": "3.3 Equilibrium\nEmpirical literature shows that reverse migration had become part of normal life since the 1970s not merely for the elderly who return home to retire but also for young and middle age individuals (Reed, Andrzejewski, and White 2010). Therefore an equivalent of equation (9) of Harris and Todaro (1970) is inadequate to describe the equilibrium when faced with return migration19. Instead of writing two equations, one for rural-to-urban and another for urban-to-rural migrations, I first derive the component of excess labor that would migrate from urban to rural sector and then obtain an equilibrium by equating the rural-to-urban migration and urban-to-rural migration components. The remaining part of this section builds on the framework proposed by (Fields 1975).\nThe urban formal sector is the prime sector of interest for most workers.20 Inasmuch as nearly everyone likes to work there, access to jobs in the sector is limited. Individuals who are unable to obtain a job can choose one of three strategies: continue to queue or search for a job opening while remaining unemployed; find work in the informal sector; or return to the rural sector. The labor market exhibits a hierarchy of sectors where difficulty of access to a job decreases in order from the formal sector, the informal sector and the rural sector. I reflect the ease of access to jobs in the formal sector by the parameter \\(\\theta\\), subject to \\(0 \\le\\theta \\le 1\\), which decreases as employment in the formal sector becomes harder to obtain. The hierarchical nature of employment choice implies that as \\(\\theta\\) decreases, larger factions of the labor force move into the states below the formal sector. An urban worker computes an expected formal wage by multiplying the formal wage by the chance of entry as \\(\\theta W_F\\).\nGiven this structure, the representative urban worker can be in one of four states. I measure the probability of being in each state by a simple function \\(V(X)\\) that depends linearly on its argument subject to the conditions \\(X\\ge0, V(0) = 0, V'(X)&gt;0\\) and \\(0\\le V(X) \\le1\\) The sorting of the urban worker into states and the corresponding probabilities are as follows:\nU1: Employed in the formal sector.\nU2: Remain unemployed and queue or search for formal employment. To make this choice, it must be that \\(\\theta W_F \\ge W_I\\) The probability of being in this state is thus measured by \\(V(\\theta W_F -W_I)\\).\nU3: Accept employment in the urban informal sector. For this choice, it must be the case that \\(\\theta W_F \\le W_I \\ge W_R\\). The probability of being in this state is measured by \\(V(W_I - W_R)\\).\nU4: Remain unemployed or join the return migrant pool. To be here, the condition \\(W_R \\ge W^\\alpha_U\\) must be satisfied. The probability of being in this state is measured by \\(V(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)\\).\nThe description of employment states yields a hierarchy of urban subsectors in which \\(\\theta\\) plays the role of a sorting parameter. As formal employment becomes competitive, individuals who do not obtain formal employment move into state U2 to queue or continue to search for formal jobs while remaining unemployed. A positive formal-informal expected wage gap \\((\\theta W_F -W_I)\\) provides the incentive to remain in this state as the average unemployed worker’s (expected) reservation wage exceeds the informal wage. As \\(\\theta\\) diminishes further and the expected wage premium disappears, the average unemployed worker becomes discouraged at formal job search and exits from unemployment to informal employment in state U3. That is, as formal employment becomes harder to find, in the absence of unemployment benefits, the worker finds it rational to accept an informal employment that he would otherwise reject. A further decrease in \\(\\theta\\) arising from further tightening of the formal employment sector pushes more workers from U1 into U2 and from U2 into U3 (the informal sector) and leads to further decrease in the informal wage until it falls below the rural wage \\((W_I &lt; W_R)\\), an occurrence which creates a disincentive to remain in urban informal employment. However, because formal employment is now tightened than ever, the average worker moves to state U4, the pool of unemployed urban proletariat who are discouraged and no longer looking for job and other workers that are willing to move to the rural sector once the condition is met. Potential return migrant workers in this group have a reservation wage that is equivalent to the rural wage, and remains in that state as long as \\(W^\\alpha_U \\ge W_R\\). Such worker returns to the rural sector when \\(W^\\alpha_U &lt; W_R\\).21\nThe notion that a worker who does not find a formal job has the option of informal employment in U3 but chooses to remain unemployed in U2 implies that urban unemployment is at least partly voluntary.22 The distribution of urban unemployment between voluntary and involuntary components will depend on factors that determine the extent of informal employment opportunities.23\nAccording to the definition, excess urban labor is the sum of labor in groups U2 and U4. Multiplying the measure of workers in the groups by total urban labor, excess urban labor is thus given by\n\\[\nN_{UE}= N_U[V(\\theta W_F - W_I) + V(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)]\n\\tag{6}\\]\nwhere \\(N_UV(\\theta W_F - W_I)\\) is the size of labor in U2 and \\(N_UV(W_R - W^\\alpha_U)\\) is the size of labor in U4.\nI now turn to the rural sector where a worker can either work in rural agriculture or migrate to the urban sector. I assume, in line with Harris and Todaro (1970) that all rural workers engage in agriculture and are part of the output-sharing group.24 I assume that rather than staying unemployed in the village, workers whose reservation wages exceed the rural wage would migrate to the city.25 The distribution of workers into employment and migration is given by\nR1: Work in rural agriculture if \\(W^e_U \\le W_R\\)\nR2: Migrate to the urban sector if \\(W^e_U \\ge W_R\\) The probability of migrating is measured by \\(V(W^e_U - W_R)\\).\nRural excess labor, all of which migrate to urban sector, is given by\n\\[\nN_{RE} = N_RV(W^e_U - W_R)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nEquations (6) and (7) provide the basis for analyzing the migration equilibrium. Equilibrium is attained when the flow of rural-urban migrants is balanced by the flow of urban-rural migrants. By making the migrating component of equation (6) equal to equation (7), the equilibrium is obtained from\n\\[\nN_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U) = N_RV(W^e_U - W_R)\n\\tag{8}\\]\nRearranging the terms of equation (8) and substituting \\(N_R = \\overline{N}-N_U\\), I obtain the migration equilibrium condition\n\\[\nV(W^e_U-W_R)/V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U) = N_U/(\\overline{N}-N_U)\n\\tag{9}\\]\nEquation (9) yields insights that are similar to Harris and Todaro (1970). A rural development program that leads to an increase in rural wage \\(W_R\\), conditional on all else, will reduce the left side by both reducing the numerator and increasing the denominator. To maintain equilibrium, the right side must also decrease by reducing the size of the urban labor. On the other hand, suppose wage increases or more jobs are created in the urban sector. This leads to increase in the left side by increasing the numerator and reducing the denominator. In response, more workers move to the city as the right side increases.26"

    "text": "3.4 Urban Unemployment in Equilibrium\nI now compare urban unemployment outcome under different strategies by examining their effects on both voluntary and involuntary components of urban unemployment.\nConsider the case of a marginal increase in agricultural wage from \\(W_R\\) to \\(W_R\\)’ following which urban labor force decreases from \\(N_U\\) to \\(N_U\\)’ The resulting urban unemployed labor is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}'= \\underbrace{N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{unchanged}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}'V({W_R}'-W^\\alpha_U)- N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{10}\\]\nBecause unemployed workers in US2 are driven by the difference between expected formal wage and the informal wage, the measure of workers in the state is not affected by increase in rural wage.27 Because \\({N_U}'&lt;N_U\\) and \\(V({W_R}'-W^\\alpha_U)&gt;V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)\\), the second component of (10) will generate an offset, thus clearing unemployment in US4. However, these gains are limited and temporary. As these workers return to the farm, rural agricultural wage would fall relative to expected urban wage and induce a new round of urban migration, which will ultimately raise the level of urban unemployment again. The experience in Kenya in the 1970s, where return migrants sooner than later began to move back to cities provides evidence in this regard.28\nNext, consider an increase in urban formal wage from \\(W_F\\) to \\({W_F}^*\\) that increases the size of urban labor from \\(N_U\\) to \\({N_U}^*\\) . As more workers move from other states into US1 as a result of the wage increase, two other things happen. First, increase in formal wage widens the expected wage premium gap and draws more workers from the informal sector US3 and the unemployed pool US4 into job search in US2. Second, the increase in urban formal wage raises expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) and induces urban migration. In this case, the resulting urban unemployed labor following from equation (6) is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}^* = \\underbrace{{N_U}^*V(\\theta {W_F}^*-W_I)-N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{increase}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}^*V(W_R-{W_U^{\\alpha}}^*)-N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{11}\\]\nwhere the first part measures the change in US2 and the second term measures the change in US4. Because \\({N_U}^*&gt; N_U, {W_F}^*&gt;W_F\\), and \\(V({W^{\\alpha}_U}^*-W_R)&gt;V(W^\\alpha_U-W_R)\\), the first part increases as formal wage increases while the terms of the second part are offsetting. The size of US4, the state that is home to the involuntarily unemployed, increases through migration from rural areas and decreases through movement of workers into states US1 to US3. In effect, increase in urban formal wage increases voluntary urban unemployment while offsetting involuntary unemployment. Overall, urban unemployment increases.\nAs a third option, consider an increase in urban informal wage from \\(W_I\\) to \\({W_I}^{\\wedge{}}\\) that leads to an increase in urban labor force from \\(N_U\\) to \\({N_U}^{\\wedge{}}\\). The increase in urban labor force is driven by increase in expected urban wage \\(W^a_U\\) arising from increase in informal wage. There are two distinct effects of this event. First, increase in \\(W_I\\) leads to reduction of the urban formal-informal wage premium and provides incentive for workers in US2 to accept informal employment, thereby reducing voluntary unemployment. Second, increase in \\(W_I\\) also induces unemployed workers in US4 who had been discouraged by low informal wage to enter the urban informal sector. Rural workers migrate from rural agriculture directly into the informal sector and thus do not contribute to unemployment. The resulting urban unemployed labor is given by\n\\[\n{N_{UE}}^{\\wedge{}} = \\underbrace{{N_U}^{\\wedge{}}V(\\theta W_F-{W_I}^{\\wedge{}})-N_UV(\\theta W_F-W_I)}_{\\text{offset}} + \\underbrace{{N_U}^{\\wedge{}}V(W_R-{W^\\alpha_U}^{\\wedge{}})-N_UV(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)}_{\\text{offset}}\n\\tag{12}\\]\nBecause \\({N_U}^{\\wedge{}} &gt;N_U, V(\\theta W_F-{W_I}^{\\wedge{}}) &lt; V(\\theta W_F-W_I)\\) and \\(V(W_R-{W^\\alpha_U}^{\\wedge{}})&lt;V(W_R-W^\\alpha_U)\\), both elements of (12) are offsets. In effect, increase in urban informal wage clears both voluntary and involuntary urban unemployment. This is achievable because while drawing workers who have been unemployed in urban areas due to the formal-informal wage premium into the informal sector (reducing unemployment at the top), it also provides opportunities for the unemployed potential return migrants. Earnings in rural agriculture will rise as workers migrate to urban informal sector until equilibrating wages are obtained. Under this strategy, average earnings are highest and overall unemployment is lowest, yielding the highest level of welfare achievable."

    "text": "3.5 Minimum Wage and Unemployment\nFrom the foregoing analysis, the most important determinant of urban unemployment is the formal sector-informal sector wage premium. To evaluate the importance of the minimum wage, let \\(W_F = \\overline{W}_M + X\\) and \\(W_I = \\overline{W}_M-Y\\), where \\(X\\) represents some form of efficiency wage premium and \\(Y\\) is the difference between informal wage and the minimum wage. Therefore, the formal-informal wage premium can be decomposed into\n\\[\n\\theta W_F- W_I = (\\theta X+Y)-(1-\\theta)\\overline{W}_M\n\\tag{13}\\]\nConsider an increase of \\(\\Delta\\overline{W}_M\\) in the minimum wage.

Unemployment depends only on the wage difference between the formal and informal sector, and the minimum wage is irrelevant. An increase in minimum wage only redistributes urban employment by increasing the relative size of the informal sector. This is consistent with the literature cited in the introduction section of this paper that changing the minimum wage has no effect on unemployment."

Because most of the off-farm nodes in the chain are located in urban areas, they represent potential sources of urban informal employment. The dairy sector in Uganda is one of the places where the concept of value-chain development has been successfully adopted. According to Mbowa, Shinyekwa, and Lwanga (2012), since the 1990s, development of the value chain has spurred income growth for about 700,000 dairy farming households, and in addition, has led to job creation for farm input dealers, dairy equipment dealers, dairy ingredient dealers, raw milk traders, milk transporters, mini-dairies, large-scale milk processors, as well as distributors. The International Labor Organization (ILO) value chain development intervention in Sri Lanka implemented between 2005 and 2009 dubbed “Enterprise for Pro-poor Growth (Enter-Growth)”30 was aimed at boosting micro and small enterprises in the flower growing value chain. The intervention impacted about 52,000 micro and small enterprises and resulted in an estimated tripling of household income and 15% increase in employment in businesses in the districts where the intervention took place."

    "text": "4.2 Access to Financial Services\nTo support the potential of value chain development, policymakers should consider incentives for financial institutions to deliver financial services to the underserved segments of the society. One of the main setbacks for lenders is that they do not have information about individuals outside of wage employment. Policymakers can help by implementing sound national identification and registration systems upon which consumer and credit information systems can be developed. Thus, a potentially sound program for employment generation should begin with a registration system that brings everyone into a formal system in a move that is akin to “formalizing the individuals.” Next step is to focus on enterprise finance for the underserved segments, which is in tandem with the development value chains in agriculture.31 One of the secondary benefits of expansion of enterprise capital is that it is likely to induce high-entrepreneur individuals to move from low-wage formal employment (where their entrepreneurial abilities are poorly rewarded) into job creation in the informal sector. Countries where the financial system is more inclusive will have enhanced capacities to generate informal employment."

    "text": "4.3 Skill Development\nIn the absence of unemployment benefits in most developing countries, open unemployment is hardly an attractive option, particularly for unskilled workers. As a result, underemployment becomes a more important issue for workers with little or no education than unemployment. Indeed, contemporary labor market lexicon tends to apply the concept of unemployment in reference to college or vocational training graduates and underemployment in reference to unskilled workers.\nUnskilled workers have little access to support networks compared to educated workers and are driven into doing something by all means.32 These workers also lack skills. Thus, in addition to developing value chains, training and skill development programs must be developed by means of training workers for the needs of the economy. Policymakers should emphasize moving away from general education to more specific skill-oriented training. Efforts to incorporate vocational training early in the education process might create interests in other forms of employment beside white-collar or blue-collar jobs. The International Labor Organization Organization (2008, v) defines effective skill development programs as those “which connect education to technical training, technical training to labor market entry and labor market entry to workplace and lifelong learning.”"

    "text": "4.4 Rural Population Growth\nIt is a stylized fact that natural population growth in rural areas far exceeds the urban rates due largely to differentials in birth rates. Population pressure on rural wages is therefore one of the push factors in urban migration. It is also the case that education, which has become the primary determinant of employment in urban formal sector and mostly available in urban areas, has increased over the years in developing countries. This section analyzes the role of these two concepts on urban unemployment.\nI showed in section 3.3 that as larger fractions of the population are educated, the value of increases on average, so that the urban wage gap increases and therefore voluntary urban unemployment increases. Increase in urban unemployment leads to increase in urban average wage \\(W^a_U\\) but reduction in urban expected wage \\(W^e_U\\). Increase in urban average wage reverses urban-rural migration and increases the rate of unemployment in U4. However, the net effect of increase in education on urban unemployment depends on the rate of population growth, which exerts pressure on the rural wage. A comparison of the relative rates of growth is therefore important.\nIf population growth exceeds the rate of growth of educated workforce, then the rural wage \\(W_R\\) falls faster than the rate at which expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) falls and average urban wage \\(W^a_U\\)increases. In expectation, the income gap between rural and urban worker rises, leading to increase in rural-urban migration and decrease in urban-rural migration. In effect, urban unemployment becomes inflated. On the other hand, if population growth is slower than the rate of growth of education, then the rural wage \\(W_R\\) falls at a slower rate than the rate at which expected urban wage \\(W^e_U\\) falls and average urban wage \\(W^a_U\\) increases. The consequence is that rural-urban migration slows down and urban-rural migration also slows down. The growth of education supply is inevitable in the 21st century and cannot be scaled down. As a result, the urban unemployment problem would require interventions to reduce rural fertility and population growth."

    "section": "Footnotes",
    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nThe conventional wisdom among economists that minimum wage creates excess labor especially among low-wage workers has greatly influenced economic policy and continues to be held as a proximate cause of unemployment in developing countries. The main idea is that a legislated wage floor set above market-clearing wage in a labor market induces excess supply of labor and creates unemployment. Although this idea emerged from analyzing a unified standard labor market that is entirely covered by regulations, the idea has been extended to multisector labor markets where some sectors may not be covered by labor regulations.↩︎\nStability of earning streams in urban jobs traditionally makes urban jobs more desirable than rural agricultural employment as the latter is vulnerable to the vagaries of weather and natural disasters. However the reforms that commenced since the 1980s induced layoffs and eroded public sector job stability in many developing countries. Jobs in the private sectors are also no longer stable as in the pre-reform era.↩︎\nIn defense of the authors, the informal sector had not become pronounced at the time their model was written. The urban informal sector did not receive attention until Hart (1971) invented the term while studying urban employment in Ghana.↩︎\nThe view that earnings in agriculture are best described as shared output was first suggested by (Lewis 1954) and emphasized by other authors such as (Fields 2005). Although individuals have different levels of productivity, actual wage do not reflect this.↩︎\nThis classification relies on self-reporting. An individual who self-reports to be unemployed might be engaged in some activities but is actively seeking a job in the formal sector. Other workers engaged in informal activities may also be seeking job opportunities in the formal sector. But as long as these workers are not actively seeking employment, they are classified as informally employed.↩︎\nThrough this medium, rural population pressure induces urban migration by driving rural earnings downward. The differentiation between marginal product and average product for many workers constitutes a “push” which guarantees that a large number of workers would easily migrate to urban areas.↩︎\nThe subcontracting relationships taking place in African countries after the reforms are characteristically different from those that existed in the Asian countries in the 1980s. While the Asian types were aimed at lowering the costs of production of manufactures in the era of export-led growth, those taking place in African countries are essentially for services of unskilled workers in the growing services sector. Firms sub-contract these jobs in order to evade minimum wage laws and other labor regulations that may require paying more wage than they are willing to offer.↩︎\nActually, the author merely quoted (Lewis 1954) description of the urban traditional sector. His reference to a 1954 description when writing in 1969 was likely a demonstration of his obliviousness of the dynamics of the informal sector.↩︎\nMore importantly, because the average migrant worker is more educated now than in the 1970s, a possibility exists that he or she is unlikely to engage in informal activities that uneducated workers are willing to do. This leads to the possibility of voluntary unemployment where workers hold out and continue to find jobs at wages they are willing to accept.↩︎\nUsing the terminology of early US literature on minimum wage Brozen (1962); Welch (1973); Tauchen (1981) this separation into formal and informal sectors is in effect a separation into covered and uncovered sectors. By this classification, all public sector employments are formal since they are covered by government regulations. Thus, all informal activities are part of the private sector. Individuals straddling both formal and informal sectors are counted as employed in the formal sector. Typically, the formal employment is designated as the primary employment.↩︎\nFirms and enterprises sort into formal and informal sector depending on a combination of the costs and benefits related to both capital and regulation. A firm with high levels of capital will choose formality because the benefits of formalizing – the protection and other benefits that come with formality – exceed the costs. A firm with low level of capital will be discouraged from formalizing because the costs are daunting compared to the benefits.↩︎\nEmpirical evidence supports this assumption. Arai (2003) and Viren (2005) provide evidence of a positive relationship between capital-labor ratio and wages.↩︎\nIt is unlikely that informal firms in this category will increase wages in order to prevent their workers from moving to the formal sector where wages are now higher. The reason is that increase in minimum wage is likely to result in layoffs from the formal sector.↩︎\nIn addition, there is anecdotal evidence that the heavy burdens of formality in some countries such as Cameroun cause registered firms to disappear from city blocks into homesteads. This would also suggest some redistribution of firms from formal to informal sectors on account of tightening regulations.↩︎\nThere are possible exceptions to this conventional wisdom. First, in relation to subcontracting, the average worker in the informal sector may earn a lower wage ex-post due to the administrative costs of subcontracting. While the formal firm has a valuation of the worker’s marginal product and is willing to keep the wage unchanged, the cost of transferring the operations to a subcontractor will on balance reduce the actual wage paid to the worker[1]. In this respect, the extent to which informal wage falls in response to an increase in the minimum wage depends on the costs and limits of subcontracting. In the absence of these costs, it is unlikely that informal wage decreases. Second, workers who enter the informal sector to invest their severance compensations are more likely to contribute to raising informal wages because of the capital they bring with them. Third, informal sector wage may rise if workers in the formal sector are the main buyers of the goods produced in the informal sector and their income elasticity of demand for informal output is relatively large (Fiszbein 1992). Fourth, minimum wage increase may be associated with increase in informal wage if the legislation is induced by factors that are external to the economy. In the case of mineral exporting countries, an increase in the world price of the natural resource may lead to expansion of the formal sector concurrently with an increase in minimum wage. The informal sector benefits both through a decrease in labor supply and increased demand for its output. Informal wage may fall for another reason – the influx of migrant workers from the rural areas. However, I demonstrate in this paper that rural-urban migration is not substantially linked to minimum wage increase.↩︎\nUrban to rural migration is commonly referred to as return migration.↩︎\nIndeed, it is unlikely that the resettlement programs in Kenya had any effect on these workers.↩︎\nIn this equation,  may also be interpreted as the likelihood that an individual finds employment in the formal sector, which reflects the difficulty of access to formal jobs. Thus, there is a strong positive correlation between  and  that is described in the next section.↩︎\nConsider an urban-rural migration time derivative  that simply interchanges the rural and urban components of Harris and Todaro (1970) equation (9). Equilibrium conditions would be obtained by equating the two migration streams. Doing so will result in an indeterminate system.↩︎\nThere are some, although in the minority, new entrants to the labor market who do not seek a formal paid job but enter directly into the informal sector. It is plausible to assume that these workers have analyzed the market and have learnt that they would only be able to work in the informal sector.↩︎\nThe parameter can also reflect the way workers in each group measure their likelihood of obtaining formal employment. The distribution of urban labor force therefore reflects self-selection among workers. For example, if education plays a role in formal employment, as it does, conditional on unemployment, an educated worker may be more likely to sort into U2 than the uneducated worker. The reason is that the educated worker will have a higher assessment of  than the uneducated worker. There are two mechanisms that can bring about this sorting. First, individuals may be driven by peer comparison. Unemployed college graduates are likely to be seeking jobs that are comparable to their peers’ in the formal sector. Second, an educated worker is more likely to value employment in terms of lifetime earnings; a strategy of temporary unemployment spell that is succeeded by high wage employment for the remainder of lifetime is preferred to a strategy of low wage employment over the entire lifetime. Estimates of lifetime earnings under the former would have to fall significantly to the level of the latter before the educated worker would accept informal employment immediately\nThe formal sector is not large enough to employ all workers seeking employment there. The job selection process is therefore non-random and allows for discrimination among workers on the basis of skills. Workers arrive at the urban labor market with education which they present as a signal of their skills but employers possess a mechanism by which they make workers to reveal their skills and hire workers whose revealed skills match the desired skills. The revelation mechanism involves employers putting job candidates through written and oral skill tests that allow workers to reveal their skills. It is thus plausible that unemployed educated workers may incorrectly consider themselves as “comparable” to peers employed in the formal sector. Whereas workers acquire education as a signal (means of obtaining formal employment), employers in non-clearing labor markets devise several strategies to extract information about true productivity and hire the most productive workers conditional on signal. This incorrect comparison may induce the unemployed to continue to seek jobs that are comparable with their peers and consider jobs paying lower wages as inferior.↩︎\nThe notion could also apply to workers in U4 who should return to rural areas if they choose to remain in the city. However, I assume that these workers return to rural areas following the wage incentives.↩︎\nThese opportunities will be limited in countries where there are strict laws regulating property rights, street trading, squatting and the use of public places and the environment. In those settings unemployment will be largely involuntary. The reverse is of course the case in developing countries where such laws do not exist, or they exist but are not enforced.↩︎\nTypically, the fraction of the rural population that declares open unemployment is very negligible.↩︎\n Inclusion of a separate group of rural unemployed workers does not add any insight to the discussion.↩︎\n[1] The main policy conclusions reached by Harris and Todaro (1970) can also be reached in this setting. Reading from the left side of equation (9), the net flow of workers between the rural sector and the urban sector differ under different regimes. In response to an increase in rural wage, the incentive to migrate among rural workers (captured in the numerator) decreases by exactly the same extent as the incentive for return migration among urban workers (captured in the denominator) increases. In effect, an additional job that becomes available in the rural sector (which reduces the incentive to migrate) is matched by exactly an urban worker that returns to the rural sector. This results in a decrease in urban unemployment. On the other hand, in response to an increase in urban formal wage, the incentive for urban migration among rural workers (captured by the numerator) increases by more than the incentive for return migration among urban unemployed workers (captured by the denominator) decreases. Interpreted along the same line, an additional job that is created in urban sector (which reduces incentive for return migration) is matched by more than one rural-urban migrant worker. Since only one worker can have the job, the unmatched migrant worker(s) will add to the urban unemployment pool.↩︎\nWorkers who move from the urban informal sector to rural sector as a result of the increase in agricultural wage do not contribute to the urban unemployment metric as they simply move from urban employment into rural employment. Rather, the change in urban unemployment is driven solely by return to rural agriculture among workers in state US4.↩︎\nThe efficacy of rural development as the cure for urban unemployment is further challenged by the extent of education. The urban bias among educated population could mean that unemployment is dominantly of the voluntary type where returning to the village is not an option.↩︎\nUsing the example of grain, Fafchamps (1999) observes that “In a typical Western country, grain is purchased from farmers by a large corporation, e.g., Cargill, processed in the corporation facilities, and sold to supermarkets and agribusinesses, who sell to final consumers. There are very few intermediaries between producer and consumer, and the size of each individual market transaction is very large. In contrast, grain in Africa is first purchased from a myriad of small farmers by collecting agents, assembled for shipment by a rural wholesaler, purchased by an urban wholesaler or processor, to be sold to retailers and, finally, micro-retailers. (p.7)↩︎\nDetails can be accessed at http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/---ifp_seed/documents/publication/wcms_175475.pdf↩︎\nThe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) of the New Partnership for Africa Development (NEPAD) designates value chains in agriculture and access to financial services as one of the core strategies under Pillar II.↩︎\nThere has been an argument about whether to classify individuals engaged in peasant activities such as street hawking and sporadic labor in urban areas as informally employed or to consider them as unemployed. There is now a consensus that those individuals are simply underemployed. Peasant activity is considered a form of employment for two reasons. First, an individual selling one stick of pen at a time is considered as working because a market exists for the retail activity: there are individuals who are unable to purchase a box of pen at a time but are only able to buy one stick at a time. The same applies to petty retail traders. Second, individuals would prefer to do those types of work rather than doing nothing because they can demonstrate to their urban support network that they are making effort to work. This is akin to work test in unemployment insurance in advanced societies.↩︎"

    "text": "Why Research?\nThe essence of research is knowledge production, or betterstill, discovery of the world around us. There are two reasons why anyone would want to do or fund research. One, we want to understand how our societies work. Studies spurred by this motive are basic in nature and are more often than not theoretical. Second, we want answers to specific questions. Such research is termed applied research. These questions are typically causal in nature and are of two types: those seeking to establish the direction of causation, asking whether increase in a variable causes increase in another, and those seeking to estimate the exact causal effect of one variable on the other. However, in general, applied research tends to take the form of the latter; the sponsors of a research are likely to be interested not merely in how a variable affects another but by how much? This latter question is usually harder to answer than the former.\nIn observing the world around us through data, the researcher seeks to discover the data generating process (DGP) of a particular outcome – what are the important determinants, what are their independent effects, how do they interact to produce the outcome we observe and what is the best way to describe or model this process? This is the crucial knowledge that feeds policymaking! This is the knowledge we require – regarding important issues – if we are going to change the society and our world. Until we can demonstrate that we understand the process correctly and can distinguish it from alternative processes, it is not clear that research can be useful in our contexts. If we do not understand the society, we cannot help it or change it in a meaningful and targeted way. The alternative is to rely on pure luck! The problem is that luck does not run very far. Having grand ideas and desires does not matter; if we cannot discover the DGP, we have not done anything useful.\nThe Place of Data\nIt is an obvious fact that no nation can produce sound and rigorous research (and science in general) more than it collects good data. Quality and comprehensive datasets allow people to observe, think, model and remodel, discover the society through produce credible evidence, and solve relevant problems. I don’t see how we can do rigorous economic research in the absence of good data! It goes without saying that the first step to accelerate knowledge production is to invest in data collection.\nBe that as it may, there is an additional problem with data collection. It is futile from hindsight to collect data in ways that abstract from society. It is rather appalling that development institutions would sponsor data collection and in the questionnaires ignore basic features of society. For example, it is well understood that the basic sphere of resource allocation and public good sharing in African societies is not the household but the extended family. Taking the nuclear household or the set of people residing within the walls of a building as constituting the entire sphere of decision making and resource allocation is simply silly. One would be looking at one of the leaking pots that are contained in a much bigger and well sealed pot. Despite the plethora of anthropological evidence to this effect, the World Bank Living Standard Measurement Surveys were designed in ways that view an African household as organized in ways similar to an American household. My most recent survey of datasets across Africa led me to only one place – the Agincourt Demographic and Health Surveillance surveys in Northern Province in South Africa – where interhousehold connections were deemed important. Viewing households in developing societies as independent economic units is just not consistent with what anthropologists have showed us!\nSocial Contexts in Research\nDefining economics as what economists do, economic research aims to generate or refine knowledge about allocation of scarce resources and the efficiency of specified allocations. Of course, economic activities do not take place in vacuum. Resource allocation is importantly characterized by the structure of incentives – opportunities and constraints reflected in the costs and benefits – inherent in the institutional setting, and these institutions could vary from one social context to another. There is a tendency, which I think is dangerous, to ignore social contexts in the pursuit of knowledge about issues that we consider as economic in nature. Because the data do not reflect society, such research efforts however grand they are will only produce “knowledge you can’t use.”\nThis realization brings with it two important implications. Of course I have assumed that the focus of inquiry is important for welfare improvement. First, the researcher needs to carefully observe society, ask initial questions on the subject of interest, and probe deeply to have a fair idea of the process that the research is aiming to uncover. Second, research does not necessarily have to begin with writing an introduction and literature review of a subject. Most often than not, influential research does not begin with getting buried into the books and papers! Sometimes, the question that a researcher initially thinks is important will end up as unimportant after asking questions about the society. For example, a researcher could be interested in improving the lives of a rural agricultural population where cattle and wood exist but cattle-driven ploughs are non-existent. The researcher could then embark on an inquiry about efficiency of cattle market: the idea that a market for cattle could allow farmers to buy cattle to create ploughs which in turn will help raise productivity and raise welfare. Suppose cattle are only given as bride price at the time of marriage and cattle trade is forbidden according to the norms. If the researcher takes time to ask questions from the people what they do with cattle and wood, and why they use cattle for bride-price and not for other means, he will quickly discover that a cattle market is a non-issue in the village and perhaps must ask a different question. Omitting this important step is akin to “putting the cart before the horse.”\nRuling Paradigm\nA typical research paper produced in indigenous African university or research institution follows more or less a rigid structure. The paper begins with framing the issue and discussing its relevance to humanity in the introduction, the literature search, the statement of the problem, the objectives of the research which are translated into corresponding hypotheses to be tested, a litany of existing models collected from around the globe and final selection of one of them to be used for the purpose of the paper, the research methodology, the data, empirical results, summary and conclusion. In fact, materials contained in the sections beginning from introduction to methodology constitute the research proposal. Once the data is acquired and analyzed, the only thing left is to append the statistical test results and the inferences to be made from them. The paper is done!\nThe process outlined also has a history. Until recently when the need to understand societies began to gain traction, most research and training programs were almost exclusively focused on macroeconomic topics such as inflation, interest rate, trade, balance of payments, and unemployment to mention a few. Indeed, the focus on macroeconomics topics were driven by data that were available and well known as well as dependence on knowledge generated from developed countries. Data sets analyzed were typically time series for studies of national phenomenon and multiple countries’ time series for studies of regional phenomenon. Since most macroeconomic concepts are typically thought to conform to standard models, there are no reasons why standard macroeconomic models that have been tested somewhere in the developed world should not be the ones applicable in the developing world. Minor distinctions or minor adjustments could be made to models while applying them elsewhere. For example, a model suited to large countries might require some slight adjustment when applied to small countries.\nAcademic training followed the knowledge dependence hypothesis where knowledge flowed from the developed world to the developing world. Most of early faculties in African institutions were trained in the west; indeed this was quite common before the cold war. Colonial masters typically sent indigene Africans abroad for doctoral training and brought them back home to help train others. It is also the case that most of those trained this way were trained mainly in the methods of macroeconomic thinking.\nThis style of doing macroeconomic research has been transported into microeconomic research. As a result, students are boxed into a corner in such a way that it is often hard to make new discoveries. I had a chance to supervise master’s students at Witwatersrand, and this is what I observed. About eight in ten of students wanted to write their thesis on topics like “the socioeconomic determinants of ….” I got tired of it and jokingly asked one student who told them that is what they should be doing? Are those theses going to inform any kind of serious decision-making? I agree they were good topics in the 1980s and even now, but these days we want to know the causal effect of important factors. We want to know what we don’t know yet! We just don’t want to rerun a model that has been run in India in Zambia. I think these are serious issues that are worth considering. How do we get out of working on safe topics that the process can allow us to examine? I understand that they are forced into those topics by the dissertation process.\nWhat has changed?\nData collection efforts at microeconomic levels have proliferated greatly since the end of the cold war, and this development has marked a great shift toward empirical microeconomic research. The proliferation of datasets comes with another development. These data shed insights into problems with inferences previously made about several phenomena that were not recognized then. For instance, the issue of selection was not widely recognized until James Heckman published a paper in 1979. Even sociologists now are more prone to mention the word “selection” than economists are. Indeed, as more datasets became available, many empirical problems that were previously unrecognized began to gain recognition and econometrics advanced rapidly. As a result, the task of establishing that you have made a discovery is far more daunting1. In fact, the more important task is not about trying to establish the idea you think you have found, but to fend off and rule out other potential interpretations of the findings. No one will believe that a serious contribution has been made until those alternative interpretations have been shut down. Now, all those alternative interpretations arise from theoretical or econometric reasoning. If a researcher knows that what is most important in the paper is the evidence and that the entire writing will make no meaning unless there is a clear demonstration that credible evidence has been found, it is clear that spending time on literature before looking at the data is not the wise way to spend research time. In fact, if I know that the quality of the paper depends more importantly on the evidence than anything else, then I should establish the evidence before doing anything else.\nMore than anything else,availability of new data should lead to breaking new grounds. These new data, if well inspected, could provide insights into breaks with the past in ways that have not been previously understood. It is hard to break new grounds if one must always begin with the past. Indeed, the idea that research must begin with the literature and existing models, after framing the issue has a potential flaw. First, some good research papers and discoveries prop up by unintentionally stumbling on something! It’s not even the issue that the researcher has thought about! Second, burying one’s head into the literature and existing models may actually keep a person squarely inside the box and unable to get out! In this case, it’s counterproductive to begin there! The idea of writing a model before the research is done is the single most important problem from my viewpoint! Unless one is writing a theoretical paper or doing an empirical test of an existing theory or (repeat) testing a theory that was tested in Finland in Ghana, I am not sure that existing theories are the first place to go. Let’s think of this. If a model fitted data from the Peruvian society, what is the basis for being the model that should fit the Malawian society? Unless the researcher allows himself to think more intensely about Malawi, and this is possible only by examining data from Malawi, it is more likely that the very important thing that distinguishes Malawi from Peru (except significance or differences in the size of coefficient estimates) will be lost! What the researcher needs to discover in Malawi would have been given away.\nOne thing that I also think has changed is the purpose of research. Research can be done with the intention of racking up articles and demonstrating one’s productivity and mastery of skills, or with the intention of changing the world. The economics profession (as practiced in North America) seems to have decided largely for the former. I think this shift is informed by failure of the policies they have advanced in the past, particularly relating to development, that have fallen flat! I think that failure was admitted in a flawed way. I remember when I went to Yale, the professors made clear that they do not intend to advise governments on what to do. That is, they are just doing their things. If you attend development conferences, you’ll realize that these folks are not interested in changing the world; they just want to enjoy what they are doing and become experts in their fields. But we learn some things from their works. That viewpoint has created problems for those with the latter intention. They must demonstrate that they can do the same thing as those professionals before their evidence can be taken seriously. It is either you are there or you are out!\nBeware of Tyranny\nThe most important danger to policymaking is the “tyranny of dead ideas.” Before the recent advances in the tools of econometric analysis, the foremost development economists simply observed events, imagined what could be the explanation according to economic theories and laid down new theories that have become the rules of the thumb. In a lot of ways, these rules are just taken as settled. For example, there is a rule that says a country must have high inequalities in order to grow. But of course we have just witnessed unprecedented rate of inequality in an economy that has had enviable long run growth. Despite the experiences, this rule is virtually repeated as true almost in any study of inequality, whether in developed or developing economies. The troubling part of it is that the rule is cited without reference to the social and policy environment that produced those outcomes.\nThe role of mentoring\nIf someone comes up to me and describes an empirical research interest, the first thing I ask the student is why it’s an important question. After this, the next thing I ask it for the student to write down the idea in terms of an econometric model and define the variables on both sides of the equation (I don’t say go and write an introduction and literature review). The next thing is to help think through the implications of potential findings and the alternative interpretations of such findings, and how to deal with the various empirical issues. That discussion and understanding of the various issues the individual has to contend with are the guides for data search. If appropriate data does not exist (sometimes administrative and survey datasets could be combined) for the purpose, then it is important to set on the journey of collecting data.\nOf course, the process outlined in the preceding paragraph requires that I stay current with the literature in the area in which I am advising a student! It requires that I know the issues and can easily refer the student to how those issues have been explored. Perhaps, this is where the problem lies. If I don’t know where the cutting edge is, I cannot guide the student this way and I have to send him to the old school.\nThe danger of the old school\nOn another note, there are different types of research and different types of research outputs. For some outputs, readers want to know the entire work from reading the introduction. They have tons of papers to read! So, if I have to write an introduction before seeing the data, then I must be prepared to write it again after seeing the data because the paper will not be read if they can’t understand the entire work from the introduction. If I wrote the model before looking at the data (except the case where I’m just testing an existing model), then I must be prepared to rewrite the model that fits the data once I’m done understanding the data. This writing and rewriting can just lengthen the process of graduating and create redundancies.\nRecommendation\nBefore a student is asked to submit a dissertation proposal, there is a need to allow for a sketchy pre-dissertation proposal, exploratory study that may involve travel and initial interviews on an area of interest. This stage allows the student to gain insight into how the society is organized and what are the important characteristics that may affect the subject of interest. The student thereafter develops a dissertation proposal and search for relevant and suitable data. In the event that the data available are unsuitable, the candidate goes ahead to design a survey based on the findings during the pre-dissertation phase."

    "text": "The essence of research is knowledge production, or betterstill, discovery of the world around us. There are two reasons why anyone would want to do or fund research. One, we want to understand how our societies work. Studies spurred by this motive are basic in nature and are more often than not theoretical. Second, we want answers to specific questions. Such research is termed applied research. These questions are typically causal in nature and are of two types: those seeking to establish the direction of causation, asking whether increase in a variable causes increase in another, and those seeking to estimate the exact causal effect of one variable on the other. However, in general, applied research tends to take the form of the latter; the sponsors of a research are likely to be interested not merely in how a variable affects another but by how much? This latter question is usually harder to answer than the former.\nIn observing the world around us through data, the researcher seeks to discover the data generating process (DGP) of a particular outcome – what are the important determinants, what are their independent effects, how do they interact to produce the outcome we observe and what is the best way to describe or model this process? This is the crucial knowledge that feeds policymaking! This is the knowledge we require – regarding important issues – if we are going to change the society and our world. Until we can demonstrate that we understand the process correctly and can distinguish it from alternative processes, it is not clear that research can be useful in our contexts. If we do not understand the society, we cannot help it or change it in a meaningful and targeted way. The alternative is to rely on pure luck! The problem is that luck does not run very far. Having grand ideas and desires does not matter; if we cannot discover the DGP, we have not done anything useful."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper analyzes an innovative model of entrepreneurship in which enterprise technology is defined by capital and enterprise output and wages are outcomes of a skill-capital matching process. In this model, enterprise quality is driven by the opportunity costs of labor and capital. A reduction in the cost of capital raises workers’ surplus, draws low-skill workers into entrepreneurship and results in low wage equilibrium while an increase in alternate wages has the opposite effect of raising enterprise wages. The potential for wage growth is determined by the extent of capital-skill gap: enterprises with gaps within a small neighborhood demonstrate a potential to grow while others are limited by competitively high price of capital or high cost of skill. The model suggests that strategies aimed at growth of entrepreneurship and wages must distinguish between existing and potential entrepreneurs. For existing entrepreneurs reinvesting wages, a program of skill upgrade is more potent than supply of low price capital; the former leads to higher wages while the latter perpetuates low wages. For enterprises generating below- subsistence wages, a strict targeting program of low-cost capital is appropriate. For potential entrepreneurs, efforts should seek to combine skill development with frameworks to match new skills to commensurate capital. A public-private partnership could achieve this goal without burdening the private sector while simultaneously eliminating inefficiencies associated with public lending programs."

    "section": "2.1 The Enterprise Sector",
    "text": "2.1 The Enterprise Sector\nWe consider an enterprise sector where capital and worker skills in the economy are exogenously given, and the distribution of enterprise types and wages are endogenous to skills and capital. An enterprise is created by matching capital with worker’s skill. We assume that the size of a unit of capital corresponds to the level of technology. For example, a low-tech enterprise requires a small size of capital and a high-tech enterprise requires a large size of capital. The enterprise creation process that we imagine is such that a low-tech enterprise can be created by workers with low, medium or high skills if they are matched with a small size of capital but a low-skill worker cannot create a medium or high-tech enterprise. In terms of productivity and wages, a high skill worker may produce more than a low-skill worker in a low-tech enterprise, but his productivity will be lower in a low-tech enterprise than in a medium or high-tech enterprise.7 In addition to skill, an individual is endowed with initial asset a and can choose to either work for a wage or to run an enterprise. An individual in wage employment earns a market wage \\(w^m\\) that depends on his skill and a return on his asset of \\(r^m\\)a where \\(r^m\\) is the market interest rate. A worker who chooses to run an enterprise must devote his entire labor endowment to it. The difference between capital invested in the enterprise and the individual’s asset is borrowed from the capital market at the borrowing rate.\nWe focus on one-person enterprises where output is determined by the production function\n\\[\ny = f(s, k; \\theta)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhich utilizes the worker’s observable skill s, physical capital k, where \\(k \\geq a\\) and unobservable worker’s ability captured by \\(\\theta\\). The production function is in all respects an individual version of the standard production function but in addition reflects the dimensions of human capital that are emphasize entrepreneurship literature. The human capital literature recognizes the potential correlation that exists between measurable skills and unmeasured ability (Bedard 2001). while the entrepreneurship literature emphasizes the importance of unmeasured ability in productivity (Evans and Jovanovic 1989).8\nThe entrepreneur’s labor is a fixed input while skill and capital are the variable inputs. In order to emphasize the matching of skill and capital while focusing on productivity of the match, we express the production technology as a function of skill-adjusted capital\n\\[\ny=f((s,k):\\theta)=f\\left(\\left(1,\\frac{k}{s}\\right):\\theta\\right)=f\\left(\\left(\\frac{k}{s}:\\theta \\right)\\right)=f(k:\\theta)\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(k=\\frac{k}{s}\\) represents skill-adjusted input and \\(\\theta=\\theta(s)\\) is a shift parameter that depends on skill and has the property \\(\\theta'(s)&gt;0.\\) In essence, an enterprise is defined by a level of skill-adjusted capital. Equation 2 accounts for two properties of the model. First, an increase in n, conditional on unmeasured ability corresponds to an increase in the quantity of capital given the level of skill. Due to complimentarity between capital and skills as in standard production technologies, an increase in n will yield an increase output but a decrease in marginal output. Second, an increase in the level of skill, for example by replacing the worker with a more skilled worker, will lead to a decrease in n but shift the production function upward through the parameter \\(\\theta\\). The reason is that an increase in observable measure of human capital is associated with an upward shift in the unobserved measure of human capital. In order to reflect these properties, we make the following assumptions:\na) \\(f(k:\\theta)\\) is increasing and concave in \\(k:f_k&gt;0\\) and \\(f_{kk}&lt;0;\\)\nb) Output and marginal returns to adjusted capital both increase by unmeasured ability, that is,\n\\(f_\\theta &gt;0; f_{\\theta k}&gt;0;\\)\nc) The Inada conditions hold: \\(lim_{{k\\to0}} f_k =\\infty\\) and \\(lim_{{k\\to\\infty}} f_k=0.\\)\nThe variable inputs receive their marginal products while enterprise profits are paid to labor as wages.9 Capital is paid its rent and skill is paid its marginal product which is equivalent to the cost of skill acquisition. In general, the cost of skill is interpreted in terms of the cost of effort in learning the use of capital. Because the cost is small when skill is high relative to capital and is large when skill is low compared to capital, the cost of skill increases with the level of skill adjusted capital. We suppress \\(\\theta\\) in the meantime and define rent and wages respectively as\n\\[\nr(k)=f_k;w(k)=f(k)-kf_k-c(k)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwhere \\(c(k)\\) is the price of skill and \\(c'(k)&gt;0.\\) The output and earnings functions are shown in Figure 7 where each point on the horizontal axis represents an enterprise. Conditional on entrepreneur’s skill, output increases as increasing levels of capital are matched with the given skill until adjusted capital reaches \\(\\overline{k}\\) , the point after which additional capital yields no increase in output. Return to capital, or rent, is the slope of the production function. From the Inada conditions, the slope is infinitely large at low levels and decreases with the level of skill-adjusted capital. We define a threshold \\(\\underline{k}\\) as the minimum level of skill-adjusted capital for an enterpriseto be viable. For values of \\(k\\le{\\underline{k}},\\) the worker earns a negative wage due to a combination of low output and high rent. The price of skill is very low at this stage because the level of skill is high relative to capital. Nonetheless, there will be no activity in that interval because workers will have to pay rent by selling off other assets.10 The price of skill rises slowly, rent continues to fall and wages begin to rise gradually over the interval \\(\\underline{k}\\le{k}\\le{\\overline{k}}.\\) Irrespective of the amount of capital, a worker with a given level of skill can achieve output that is no more than \\(f(\\overline{k})\\) in the absence of skill upgrade. For values \\(k&gt;\\overline{k},\\) output remains nearly flat due to concavity of the production function and rent stays flat (near zero) as well but the cost of skill rises as skill levels relative to capital are falling. This leads to decrease in wages as we move beyond the point \\(\\overline{k}.\\) Therefore, the entrepreneur’s wage is maximized at \\(\\overline{k}.\\) We designate \\(\\overline{k}\\) as the efficient level of adjusted capital input, the level at which capital is commensurate with skill.\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Output, Interest and Wages.\n\n\nWe demonstrate in in Figure 8 the effect of skill upgrade from \\(s\\) to \\(s'\\) reflected by a shift in the parameter \\(\\theta.\\) Given capital, skill upgrade shifts the output and rent curves upward but the extent of the shift increases with \\(k\\) in line with assumption b) above. The shift produces two effects. First, the point at which wages become positive shifts to the left reflecting the increase in productivity of skill. However, the shift at this end is small because output increases only by a little while rent also increases by a little; the net effect on \\(\\underline{k}\\) may be negligible. Second, the efficient level of adjusted capital shifts to the right in reflection of increased capacity of the worker to utilize a larger quantity of capital given the shift in unmeasured ability. In effect, the feasible range \\([\\underline{k},\\overline{k}]\\) widens with skill upgrade. However, because the skill cost function depends only on adjusted capital and not on output, it remains unchanged after the skill upgrade; the cost of skill only depends on the relative level of skill and capital along the horizontal axis. Thus the difference between the shift in output and the shift in rent widens as \\(k\\) increases, causing an increasing shift in the wage function. Consider an enterprise with initial adjusted capital of \\(k_0\\) that experienced a skill upgrade. Although adjusted capital decreases nominally from \\(k_0\\) to \\(k_1\\), wage increases from \\(w(k_0)\\) to \\(w(k_1)\\). It is also plausible from the rent graph that \\(r(k_1)&gt;r(k_0)\\) In general, an increase in wage is accompanied by increase in rent when driven by skill upgrade (represented by the upward shift in the rent curve) , but is accompanied by a decrease in rent when it is driven by capital upgrade (represented by moving to the right on the horizontal axis).\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Effect of Skill Upgrade.\n\n\nWe examine in Figure 9 the potential wage trajectory of enterprises with efficient levels of adjusted capital to demonstrate the implication of the earnings and cost structure for enterprise profitability. The vertical axis represents capital while the horizontal axis represents skill. We use the 45 degrees line to represent wage outcomes of optimal matches between skill and capital where skill and capital are commensurate. Because skill and capital are typically measured in very different units and scales which we do not attempt to reconcile, the 45 degrees line reflects \\(commensurability\\) instead of \\(equality\\) of skill and capital. In essence, skill upgrade is matched by corresponding increase in capital as we move along the line so that wages earned by optimal matches increase along the line. Figure 8 is connected to Figure 9 in the sense that an enterprise with \\(k&gt;\\overline{k}\\) lies above the 45 degrees line while an enterprise with \\(k&lt;\\overline{k}\\) lies below the line.\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Enterprise Wage Trajectory.\n\n\nThe broken vertical line at \\(s=s_0\\) represents the locus of initial adjusted capital of an enterprise. Consider an enterprise that starts with \\(k_a\\) where the capital is less than commensurate with skill (this translates to a very small value of \\(k\\) in Figure 8. At that level, output is low, the price of skill is low but rent is high, yielding a very low wage. An enterprise that begins at this point will find the cost of capital prohibitive and is unlikely to invest in capital. Because the cost of skill is low, the enterprise may choose to invest in more skills. But the enterprise will not benefit from such investment as it will not raise wages meaningfully: adjusted capital will decrease and rent will increase. The high rate of rent will eat away any increase in output achieved by raising the level of skill. In the absence of any investment, the high rent will drive enterprise wages westward until reaching the point a on the 45 degrees line.\nIt is interesting to note that equilibrium wage for the enterprise that started at \\(k_a\\) is exactly the wage that would be earned by an individual with skill \\(s_a\\) that is provided with capital that is just efficient for the worker, which results in adjusted capital of \\(\\overline{k}_a\\). Therefore an individual entrepreneur with skill \\(s_0\\) will earn the same wage as an individual with skill \\(s_a&lt;s_0\\). An enterprise that begins with \\(k_b\\) will face a similar experience. Consider an enterprise that begins at \\(k_c.\\) In that region, rent and cost of skill are both moderate but rent is falling while the cost of skill is rising. In the absence of any upgrade, or considering increase in skills only, enterprise wage will reach equilibrium at point \\(c\\) on the trajectory. However, additional investment in capital only, such as through reinvestment of wages, will lead enterprise wage northward until it reaches \\(w(\\overline{k}_0)\\). Intuitively, additional capital is being added to a production process that is utilizing relatively high entrepreneurial skill. As a result, wages rise until it reaches the efficient level. However, additional investment in both capital and skills, with more on the capital side (maybe through wage reinvestment) to take advantage of falling rent, will raise wages and lead the enterprise to point \\(d\\) on the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_d\\) faces similar situation as one that starts at \\(k_C\\) with the difference that it has to invest more in skill than capital. Because of rising cost of skills, wages will initially fall as the entrepreneur invests in more skill until the enterprise latches onto the efficient trajectory. An enterprise that begins at \\(k_e\\) has very low skill compared to capital and faces prohibitive cost of skill but very low cost of capital. In the absence of skill upgrade due to the high cost, wages will fall and the enterprise will shrink in terms of capital until it reaches the size of an enterprise that started at \\(k_d\\) when it can begin investing in skill because skill costs are now moderate. Thus, an enterprise that started out with much larger capital than skill will shrink at first before it can grow.\nEvery enterprise will reach an equilibrium that is represented by a point on the 45 degree line. Given that entrepreneurs reinvest wages net of consumption in practice, an enterprise moves vertically north of its old equilibrium because capital increases through wage reinvestment while skill remains unchanged. In the absence of a matching skill upgrade, wages will fall and the firm will be back to its old equilibrium 11.However, investment in additional skills will move the reinvesting enterprise eastward and therefore move to another point on the 45 degree line.\nEnterprise stability depends on two conditions. First, equilibrium wage must exceed a threshold level: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w_0\\) where \\(w_0\\ge0\\) is a floor wage12. for example \\(w(\\overline{k}_b)&lt;w_0\\) implies that enterprises at point \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in Figure 9 are unstable. Second, equilibrium wage must be not less than the starting efficient wage: \\(w(\\overline{k})^e \\ge w(\\overline{k})^0\\) where \\(w(\\overline{k})^0\\) is is the wage that should have been earned if the initial match was efficient given the worker’s skill. This condition implies that an enterprise at point \\(c\\) is also unstable. Combining the two conditions, the stability condition is\n\\[\nw(\\overline{k})^0 \\le w(\\overline{k})^0 \\ge w_0.\n\\tag{4}\\]\nEquation 4 implies that an enterprise is stable only if the capital-skill “gap” is within a small neighborhood where rent and the cost of skill upgrade are both small. This is intuitively the goal of credit assessment prior to lending. While lenders are unlikely to create the exact efficient match \\(k=\\overline{k}\\), they endeavor to create matches within a neighborhood \\(k \\in (\\overline{k} -\\delta, \\overline{k} +\\delta)\\) that satisfies condition (4)."

    "text": "3.1 Structure of Enterprise Sector\nThe enterprise sector comprises entities where entrepreneurs employ their endowed assets without borrowing as well as entities created through borrowing. For enterprises financed solely by endowed assets, given the possibility of borrowing to ease credit constraints, it must be the case that \\(\\alpha = \\overline{k}.\\) It is therefore safe to assume that self-financed enterprises are positioned along the \\(w(\\overline{k})\\) trajectory depending on the equilibrium wage determined by the match between endowed assets and skills15. The assumption is not implausible for the following reason. The framework implies that such enterprises cannot grow by merely adding capital because adjusted capital is at the efficient level. That is, profit reinvestment only, without skill upgrade, will not lead to increase in wages. This implication is compatible with evidence from various studies of self employment suggesting that entrepreneurship skills are the most important constraint to small business growth (Yahya et al. 2011).\nEnterprises created through borrowing face entirely different dynamics. In general the worker and the lender must have incentives to create an enterprise. Given the opportunity cost of capital of \\(r^m\\) and alternative wages of \\(w^m\\), the joint surplus of the worker and the lender in creating the enterprise is given by\n\\[\nV(k) = [w(k)-w^m -r^ma][r(k)-r^m]\n\\tag{6}\\]\nThe first term on the right side is the worker’s surplus which is the difference between enterprise wage and the opportunity cost: alternate wages and forgone income from endowed assets.\nSimilarly, the second term is the lender’s surplus which is the excess of rent over the opportunity cost of capital. An enterprise will be created if and only if the worker and the lender earn positive surpluses. Indeed, creation of an enterprise is subject to the existence constraint\n\\[\nV(k) \\ge V_0(w_0,r_0)\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhere \\(w_0\\) is a floor wage and \\(r_0\\) is a floor return required by lenders. We now investigate how changes in the exogenous variables affect both the size and the structure of the enterprise sector.\nConsider an increase in interest rates \\(r^m\\). Lenders’ surplus decrease as the opportunity cost of capital increases. As a result, lenders must ration capital by pursuing either of two options. One, they can reduce the amount of capital offered to all intending entrepreneurs. But this option will lead to a general decrease in wages so that more enterprises would violate the stability constraint (4). Second, they can exclude lending to low-tech enterprises that would not satisfy the existence constraint following the increase in interest rate. The resultant upward shift in skills leads to increases in both wages and rent. This shift is illustrated in Figure 11 . Supply of capital falls on the lender’s side of the market and causes the enterprise labor demand curve to shift to the left. At the same time, an increase in interest rate reduces the worker’s surplus through increase in return on endowed asset. In response, workers with low skills who are unable to generate the required return will exit the enterprise sector causing the supply curve to shift to the left, causing a decrease in the quantity of labor and increase in average skills. Skill-adjusted capital reduces nominally but the production function shifts upward as presented in Figure 8. Because the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, adjusted capital decreases and wage increases in comparison to the initial equilibrium. In effect, rising interest rates squeeze out low-skill-low-tech enterprises because they are unable to generate positive surpluses at prevailing costs. On the other hand, a decrease in interest rates pushes the demand and supply curves to the right, resulting in higher skill-adjusted capital, large number of low-skill-low-tech enterprises, and lower wages in equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Increase in Interest rate r\n\n\nAn increase in alternate wage \\(w^m\\) reduces only the worker’s side of the surplus function, and workers with low entrepreneurial skills will exit from the enterprise sector, leading the enterprise labor supply curve to shift to the left while the demand curve remains unchanged. As shown in Figure 12, skill-adjusted capital falls and equilibrium wage rises. On the other hand, a decrease in \\(w^m\\) raises the workers’ surplus and attracts more workers into entrepreneurship.\n\n\n\nFigure 12. Increase in Alternate Wages w\n\n\nAverage skills decrease, and skill-adjusted capital increases, leading to lower equilibrium wages. Thus, an increase in interest rates or alternate wages has the effects of raising average skills and wages in the enterprise sector. This is consistent with the stylized facts: co-movement of interest rates and wages, and co-movement of wages across sectors. But the extent of wage increase and changes in adjusted capital depend on whether the change is driven by wages or interest rates. Changes in relative enterprise wages (ratio of enterprise wages to alternate wages) depends on the ease of entry into the enterprise sector, which depends on the ease of finding capital. If credit markets are well developed so that entry and exit from self employment is unconstrained, then relative enterprise wages will fall and rise faster than in societies with less developed credit markets."

    "text": "4.1 Skill and Capital Mobility\nIn general, there are skill overlaps between the sectors. Workers at the high end of the agricultural sector skill distribution are comparable to workers in the enterprise sector.16 Similarly, some workers at the high end of the enterprise sector skill distribution are those who could be in the formal wage sector but voluntarily choose the entrepreneurship sector. Given the impracticality of direct transition from the agricultural sector to the formal wage sector for many workers, inter-sectoral mobility assumes the form of a step-like or “ladder” function.17 We assume a fixed-capital economy with mobility of capital and labor across sectors. Increase in agricultural or urban formal wage draws workers away from the enterprise sector while a decrease has the reverse effect. Whenever workers are drawn away from enterprise sector, the workers left behind are selectively more productive. It is plausible to assume that individuals with higher entrepreneurial skills are less likely to leave the enterprise sector."

    "text": "4.2 General Equilibrium Dynamics\nConsider the impact of growth in the formal wage sector. Given the supply of skills, the labor demand curve shifts to the right and wages and employment both increase. This leads to increase in alternate wages, which will reduce employment in the enterprise sector. Individuals with high skill but end up at points a, b and c in Figure 9 will be the first set to exit the sector due to underemployment of their skills. Although some low-tech enterprises might remain because some low-skill workers could remain, enterprise wages will nevertheless increase. The increase in enterprise wages might attract agricultural workers with above-average skills, especially in cases where agriculture is predominantly peasant and small-scale, leading to a decrease in average skills and reduction in agricultural wages.\nAn increase in agricultural wage, driven by technological change or improvement in climatic conditions, raises alternate wages for workers at the bottom of skill distribution in the enterprise sector. Low-skill workers in low-tech enterprises will exit the enterprise sector for the agricultural sector, leading to higher wages, higher skills and lower employment in the enterprise sector. The impact on the formal sector would at best be minimal. While some workers may move directly from the formal wage sector into agriculture, the increase in enterprise wages may also attract comparable workers from the formal sector. The net effect on the formal wage sector depends on the part of the skill distribution that workers exit from.\nA strategy of reducing the cost of enterprise capital increases the surplus on the workers’ side of the joint surplus function. Workers move out of the agricultural and formal wage employments into entrepreneurship, shifting the entrepreneurship labor supply curve to the right. However, the effect on the lenders’ side depends on whether the program is a private or a public sector initiative. If private lenders reduce their interest rates but continue to appraise loans on the basis of productivity, they are likely to remain selective in terms of enterprise skills in order to reduce the risks of default. The reduction of lending rate is reflected in a movement along the demand curve. Conditional on supply adjustment, enterprise wages will decrease and skill adjusted capital will increase as in Figure 13. On the other hand, if the lending policy is driven by public policy, the outcome will be as if interest rates are reduced exogenously, which also leads to lower wages and higher skill-adjusted capital. However, for identical reduction in interest rate, the difference lies in the degree to which the skill composition of the sector changes, which can be deduced by comparing Figure 13 (drawn to yield identical reduction in interest rate) and a reversal of Figure 11. Notice that, in equilibrium, the increase in adjusted capital (decrease in overall level of skill) is very large in the case of public policy and very small in the case where private lenders cut lending rates. That is, the selective mechanism of private lenders that accompany reduction of lending rates allows minor reductions in enterprise productivity while the skill blind process that accompanies public low-interest capital schemes largely undermine productivity.\n\n\n\nFigure 13. Low interest lending from private sector.\n\n\nSuppose instead that vocational or entrepreneurial skill is upgraded. That is, instead of quantitative increase in labor supply we have a qualitative increase in entrepreneurial skills, which shifts the supply curve to the left. In this case, adjusted capital will fall (capital-skill gap will close) and wages will rise. Thus, skill upgrade is more potent than low-cost capital for poverty reduction. Stagnation in production processes with more credit supply has generated increased employment in the enterprise sector but has not made a significant dent on poverty rates. Low-productivity activities are easy to replicate and they generate low returns when matched with low cost capital. Studies relating to Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises show that lack of skills, rather than lack of capital, are responsible for the slow growth of the sector.\nHowever, the policy of skill upgrade alone must be directed toward those already engaged in entrepreneurship and are reinvesting wages. Suppose that unemployed workers, those outside entrepreneurship, are provided with additional skills. In the absence of deliberate efforts to expand access to enterprise capital (not by cutting lending rates), these workers will become job seekers in the formal sector rather than becoming entrepreneurs. Considering the wage profile where the formal sector offers the highest returns, these newly trained workers would simply join the pool of unemployed workers seeking formal employment."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAlthough many factors have been advanced for expansion of self‐employment, the government initiatives were undoubtedly central. In order to combat high unemployment that persisted into the late 1970s, the British government under Margaret Thatcher created several initiatives aimed at supporting self‐employment beginning from 1981. These initiatives include the Enterprise Allowance Scheme which provided guaranteed income of GBP40 per week to unemployed people that set up an enterprise, the Loan Guarantee Scheme through which the government provided the security that lenders usually require in order to facilitate lending to viable small businesses that may lack access to finance, and the Business Expansion Scheme that aimed to provide investment opportunities for investors↩︎\nThese efforts came in many forms. There were pressures on lending institutions to reduce interest rates, leading to development of enterprise finance initiatives by commercial banks and other financial institutions. Some assistance also came in the form of credit guarantees. These efforts drew a large number among the unemployed workers into entrepreneurship.↩︎\nGovernments in Africa and other developing countries implemented low‐cost capital schemes during 1970s and early 1980 and the outcomes were self‐defeating. Earnings plunged, default rates rose and poverty rates arising from very low wages skyrocketed. The self‐defeating growth of higher employment and lower wages following increased supply of low‐cost capital could be attributed to several factors. First, an exogenous decrease in the cost of capital will result in lower average skills and therefore reduce enterprise productivity. Output produced by low‐ tech enterprises is typically non‐tradable and only subject to demand for domestic consumption. In countries where imported goods are favored over domestic products due to either preferences or quality issues, low‐tech enterprise output growth is associated with product glut and low prices. Second, other than capital requirement, there is free‐entry into the sector and low‐tech production systems can easily be replicated. Free entry ensures that output prices and therefore earnings are driven to razor‐thin competitive levels. The absence of institutional barriers and coordination failures make price regulations impossible. Third, an increased supply of capital that is not driven by skills will have different implications than supply shift that is driven by skills. Increased supply of capital that is driven by skill upgrade moves the enterprise sector toward more productive enterprises and leads to higher wages. On the other hand, an increase in the supply of capital without efficient matching leads to lower wages and reduction in enterprise efficiency levels.↩︎\nExpectation of positive selection on ability into wage employment in non‐competitive labor markets is based on the assumption that individuals with high ability are likely to be selected by employers. In non‐clearing markets, employers subject job candidates to series of tests – written, oral and situation‐room types of experiences – in order to select the most able candidates. Because these opportunities are limited, individuals with the highest abilities are often drawn into wage employment at least for the first few years of their careers. However, the sample of workers who seek wage employment may not be representative of the labor force. Indeed, if individuals with the highest levels of ability choose not to seek wage employment, then positive selection on ability into wage employment among job‐seekers will not translate into positive selection on ability for the entire labor force.↩︎\nA loan guarantee reduces the cost of capital in two ways. First, it eliminates the transactions cost component of lending rates. Second, it eliminates the opportunity cost associated with forgone earnings from assets that would otherwise be pledged as collateral.↩︎\nThe deficit of attention to skill and capital matching is not surprising. It is always assumed, and taken for granted, that the credit market is capable of creating efficient matches between capital and skill in the formation of enterprises. But there are noteworthy grounds to believe that this is not always the case. The practice in the credit market to screen borrowers on the basis of perception of information asymmetry rather than on the basis of borrowers’ productivity implies that high productivity individuals lacking collateral may be denied access to entrepreneurship capital.↩︎\nCompare a high school dropout with a Masters’ of Science in civil engineering. Both of them can fry plantains but the dropout cannot supervise road construction. Meanwhile, it is possible that the M.Sc. will fry more plantains in a unit of time than the dropout. In an economy endowed by capital for frying plantains, everyone would fry plantain. On the other hand, if capital is only available for road construction, then the engineers are employed while the dropouts are unemployed. If capital is only available for road construction in an economy populated by high school dropouts, then no construction enterprise is created and nobody is employed.↩︎\nAn individual’s education or skill is positively correlated with his unmeasured ability. It is implausible that the level of education an individual attains alone summarizes all the productive skills that may be productive in entrepreneurship, neither is it plausible to assume that innate ability alone summarizes them. Existence of complementarities between observed education and unobserved ability is arguably plausible.↩︎\nThis is consistent with the practice where the profits of the enterprise are considered as earnings of the entrepreneur. The only difference is that we separate returns to labor from returns to skill in the model.↩︎\nThis corresponds to an extremely high rate of underutilization (or underemployment) of worker skills.↩︎\nThe conditions under which an enterprise remains in equilibrium are discussed in details in Appendix A.↩︎\nThe wage floor increases with the cost of capital and alternate wages.↩︎\nIntuitively, rising wages indicate higher returns in the sector, and attracts more workers and lenders as long as rent exceeds the cost of capital. This leads to increase in capital supplied to the sector, and consequently, decrease in rent.↩︎\nDetails of the derivation are provided in Appendix B.↩︎\nThe literature on intergenerational wealth transfer has examined the possibility that individuals who receive large bequeaths are also likely to come from households endowed with high entrepreneurial skills. Therefore, we expect to observe a strong correlation between enterprise skill and endowed asset in a cross‐section of entrepreneurs.↩︎\nBoth sets of workers are likely to have had some formal education and vocational or apprenticeship training.↩︎\nFor example, unskilled workers from the rural area that arrive in the urban center in search of formal sector jobs must enroll in appropriate skill development program or course of study that may take some time to complete. In the meantime, such workers will engage in activities in the entrepreneurship sector or otherwise remain unemployed while attending school. It is on this basis that the model reconciles with the previous models that describe the enterprise sector as a transit sector.↩︎\nA reading of Yunus (2003) shows that early microcredit was targeted at workers with observable productivity. One of the weaknesses inherent in subsequent microfinance practice is that loans are often targeted at workers with latent productivity. The non‐observability of productivity for many of the clients and the lack of sensitivity of loan amounts to productivity introduced important imperfections in the capital‐skill matching process in microcredit schemes.↩︎"

    "text": "We consider a closed overlapping-generations economy operating over an infinite discrete time horizon, starting with period 0. Individuals with perfect foresight invest in education and assets under capital market imperfection. However, the production of a single good occurs in a perfectly competitive environment where a single good produced can be consumed, invested, or passed on to the next generation. Population is exogenous and technology is assumed to be exogenous and stationary over time. Markets are imperfect in the sense that borrowing in the earlier periods of life for education acquisition is not possible. In particular, investment in education, which is apparently indivisible in this model, has to be financed out of savings of parents.1 In the adulthood (time \\(t\\)) each individual is allowed to invest, borrow, and/or lend at the market interest rate \\(R_t\\).\n\n\nThe amount of aggregate output produced in the adulthood (time \\(t\\)), \\(Y_t\\), is determined by the aggregate stock of physical capital at time \\(t\\) (adulthood), \\(K_t\\), and the existing amount of efficient labor \\(N_t\\) — where \\(N_t\\) is the amount of efficient labor—is defined as follows:2 (Rainer and Nardini, 2007)\n\\[\nN_t = \\lambda_tH_t^P + (1-\\lambda_t)L_t^P \\tag{1.1.1}\\\\    \n\\]\nWe assume that \\(\\lambda_t \\in (0,1)\\), and \\(ρ≤1\\). \\(H_t\\) and \\(L_t\\) are numbers of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively; where \\(H_t+L_t=Z_t\\). At different stages of economic development, unskilled (skilled) workers might be relatively more abundant than skilled (unskilled) workers for aggregated production.\nFollowing Rainer and Nardini (2007), we assume that skilled and unskilled workers are perfect substitutes if \\(ρ=1\\), and perfect complements if \\(ρ=-∞\\). Notice, however, that in Acemoglu (2002), the two inputs are referred to as gross substitutes if \\(0≤ρ&lt;1\\), and as gross complements if \\(ρ&lt;1\\). Let \\(φ_t\\) be the ratio of the number of skilled workers to that of all workers \\(Z_t\\). The aggregate supply of skilled workers at time t is \\(H_t=\\phi_t Z_t\\) and that of unskilled workers is \\(L_t=(1-φ_t)Z_t\\).\nThe aggregate production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form:\n\\[\nY_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{1.1.2}\\\\     \n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\),and \\(A&gt;0\\) stands for the level of technology. The market price of the final good is normalized to 1.\nProducers can freely rent the services of capital and labor from household through competitive factors markets. Hence, they maximize their profits given the market wages per unit of skilled and unskilled labors, \\(w_t^H,w_t^L\\) and the rental price per unit of physical capital, \\(R_t\\). Solving this problem is equivalent to choosing \\(H_t\\), \\(L_t\\), and \\(\\:K_t\\) that maximize \\(Y_t - w^HH_t - w_t^L L_t - r_t K_t\\) subject to \\(Y_t = AK_t^\\alpha (N_t^\\frac{1}{P})^{1-\\alpha}\\) . The associated equilibrium wages of skilled and unskilled labors and the equilibrium price of physical capital are given by:\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) \\lambda \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} H_t^{p-1}    \n\\]\n\\[\nw_L^H = (1 - \\alpha) (1-\\lambda) \\frac{Y_t}{N_t} L_t^{p-1} \\tag{1.1.3}\\\\     \n\\]\n\\[\nq_t = \\alpha \\frac{Y_t}{K_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nA new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project.

    "text": "A new generation of individuals is born in each period, living over the course of two periods. The first period is divided between childhood and adulthood, while the last period coincides with old age or retirement. Since there is no decision process involved in the childhood, the economy will account for two generations at any point in time, namely adult and elderly persons. Individuals may be different in their initial wealth, yet they are homogeneous in all other aspects. The working population in each generation is \\(Z_t\\), with a fraction \\(φ_t\\) of the total population belonging to a group of skilled workers and a fraction \\((1-φ_t)\\) of the total population belonging to a group of unskilled workers. Hence, an individual born in period \\(t\\) is referred to as a member of cohort \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), or simply a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\).\nLetting \\(\\eta_t^i\\) be an indicator function which takes a value of 1 when an individual invests in education and 0 if otherwise, and reiterating the fact that \\(w_t^H\\) and \\(w_t^L\\) are the wages of skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, the budget constraint in adulthood (time \\(t\\)) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t) \\tag{1.2.1}\\\\   \n\\]\nwhere \\(P_t\\) indicates the cost of education for each individual during his young age, \\(s_t^i\\) indicates savings made by an adult member of generation \\(t\\). \\(s_t^i = \\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1 - \\eta_t^i) w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t)\\) is the first period wealth after investment in education has occurred, that is, when \\(\\eta_t^i=1\\).\nIn the childhood, when young, each agent engages in skills acquisition. Investment in education is indivisible and is financed out of savings of parents; making poverty dynamics an issue in this model. Since a young agent is credit constrained when acquiring knowledge, education costs have to be covered out by parents through an intergenerational transfer (or bequest), \\(b_t^i\\). If transfers from a parent is not enough to cover the entire cost of education, then there is no investment in education since capital markets are imperfect and there is no possibility for borrowing. However, if parental transfers exceed the cost of education, the excess is saved for the second period of life at the market interest rate \\(r_{t+1}\\). Hence, investment in education is feasible only if transfers from parents are at least equal to the costs of acquiring education, that is, if\n\\[\nb_t^i \\ge P_t \\tag{1.2.2}\\\\\n\\]\nFor simplicity’s sake, we assume that the cost of education is proportional to total output. In particular, we set \\(P_t = pY_t\\), where \\(p\\) is the fraction of a household’s income that is allocated to investment in education of the next generation.\nIt is important to note that invest in education is attractive only if the skill premium is larger than the costs of education, that is: \\(w_t^H-w_t^L≥P_t\\). Using (1.1.3), we derive a condition under which it is optimal to invest in education:\n\\[\n(\\lambda H_t^{p-1} - (1-\\lambda) L_t^{p-1}) \\ge \\frac {p}{1-\\alpha} N_t \\tag{1.2.3}\\\\   \n\\]\nEquation (1.2.3) is associated with the well-known skill-premium condition where the left hand side (LHS) is the difference between skilled and unskilled workers’ wages, and the right hand side (RHS) is the cost of investing in a child education.\nIn each generation, a member \\(i\\) will use his/her savings for investment in real capital (economic capital) that can be sold to the final producer in period \\(t+1\\) at price \\(q_{t+1}\\), lend or borrow money at the same interest rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\). The second period wealth of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(I_{t+1}^i\\), depends on whether saving by a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\), \\(s_t^i\\), are sufficient to cover the costs of investment in real capital \\(k_t\\). If \\(s_t^i &lt; k_t\\) the individual borrows the additional required funds in the first period of life, \\((k_t - s_t^i)\\) and repay the loan with interest rates in the second period. If, however, \\(s_t^i &gt; k_t\\) the individual finance the entire cost of investment in real capital and lend the excess funds, \\((s_t^i - k_t)\\) at the market interest rate. Hence, in the second period of life the individual wealth consists of interest on savings and income on real capital, i.e.,\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = (s_t^i - k_t)r_{t+1} + q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t   \n\\]\nNote that \\(\\phi^i\\) is the marginal productivity of each member \\(i\\), with \\(\\phi^i \\in [\\phi^L, \\phi^H]\\). Notice that a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) may choose not to invest in real capital if his productivity \\(\\phi^i\\) is below a certain threshold. As will become apparent in the next sections, the individual will only hold bonds and/or debts and become a net lender. In the second period his wealth will reduce to:\n\\[\nI_{t+1}^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i   \n\\]\nwhere \\(r_{t+1}\\) is a market gross interest rate3.\nAs noted earlier, each member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) can choose to start a project using his savings and borrowing from the bank. Following Kiminori Matsuyama (2002), the project comes in discrete, indivisible units and each member \\(i\\) can only run one project4. The project transforms \\(k_t\\) units of the final good in period \\(t\\) into \\(\\phi^i k_t\\) units of capital in period \\(t+1\\). For the sake of exposition’s simplicity, we focus on the case where\n\\[\ns(\\phi^ik_t) &lt; k_t \\tag{A.A.1}\\\\\n\\]\nThis assumption ensures that \\(s_t^i&lt;k_t\\), so that the agent needs to borrow \\((k_t-s_t^i)&gt;0\\) in the competitive credit market, in order to start the project. The credit market is competitive in the sense that both lenders and borrowers take the equilibrium rate, \\(r_{t+1}\\), as given. It is not competitive, however, in the sense that the bank imposes credit constraints on borrowers in order to avoid default. Knowing this, the bank will only commit to lend up to a certain fraction of his wealth, i.e.,\n\\[\nd_t^i \\ge -\\mu k_t \\tag{A.A.2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(d_t^i \\equiv (k_t-s_t^i)\\) is negative and amounts to debt. As noted above, each member I of generation t can borrow from the bank up to \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\mu&gt;0\\), times his wealth. As will become clear in the subsequent sections, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is the index of financial development. When \\(\\mu \\rightarrow 0\\), the financial market is nonexistent; both borrowing and lending are not possible. If however \\(\\mu\\) is large, the credit market is perfect and each member \\(i\\) has the ability to borrow from the bank as much money as he requires.\nThe preferences of a member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) are defined over consumption in the old age, \\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and over the transfers to a child, \\(b_{t+1}^i\\). They are represented by the log-linear utility function below:\n\\[\nu(c_{t+1}^i, b_{t+1}^i) = (1-\\beta) Inc_{t+1}^i + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i   \\tag{1.2.4}\n\\]\nThe underlying premise in (1.2.4) is that intergenerational transfers are luxury goods and are motivated by the “joy of giving”.5\nEach member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) faces budget constraints in the first and second periods as follows:\n\\[\nd_t^i + k_t \\le s_t^i \\tag{1.2.5}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_{t+1}^i \\le q_{t+1} \\phi^ik_t + r_{t+1}d_t^i - b_{t+1}^i\\tag{1.2.6}\n\\]\nA member \\(i\\) of generation \\(t\\) chooses his old age consumption,\\(c_{t+1}^i\\), and a non-negative aggregate level of transfers to the offspring,\\(b_{t+1}^i\\), so as to maximize the utility function in (1.2.4) subject to the constraints in (A.A.2), (1.2.5), and (1.2.6). In other terms the maximization can take the following form:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[q_{t+1}\\phi^ik_t + d_t^ir_{t+1} -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n\\left\\{\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n        s_t^i = k_t + d_t^i \\\\\n        d_t^i \\ge-\\mu k_t\n    \\end{array}\n\\right.\n\\]\nWe replace \\(d_t^i\\) by \\((s_t^i - K_t)\\) in the above maximization, and we combine the two last constraints to obtain the following maximization problem:\n\\[\nMax_{(b_{t+1}^i,d_t^ik_t)} U = (1-\\beta)In[r_{t+1}+q_{t+1}[\\phi^iq_{t+1} - r_{t+1}]k_t -  b_{t+1}^i] + \\beta In b_{t+1}^i \\tag{1.2.7}\n\\]\nsubject to\n\\[\n0 \\le k_t \\le \\frac {s_t^i}{1-\\mu}\n\\]\nAssume that\n\\[\n\\phi^i &lt; (r_{t+1}/q_{t+1}) \\equiv \\Phi_t  \\tag{A.A.3}\n\\]\nno member i would invest in real capital6.In this case, \\(k_t=0\\), and each member I hold his wealth in form of debt or bonds, i.e., \\(r_{t+1}d_t^i = r_{t+1}s_t^i = c_{t+1}^i + b_{t+1}^i\\).\nThe rest of the demand functions will follow from first order conditions with respect to \\(c_{t+1}^i\\) and \\(b_{t+1}^i\\) are given below:\n\\[\nb_{t+1}^i = \\frac {\\beta}{1-\\beta}R_{t+1}q_t^i  \\tag{1.2.8}\n\\]\nNotice that \\(q_t^i\\) = \\(w_t^H + (b_t^H -P_t)\\) when \\(\\eta_t^i = 1\\), and \\(q_t^i = w_t^L + b_t^L\\), when \\(\\eta_t^i = 0\\); with \\(b_t^H - P_t &gt; 0\\).\nFollowing equations (1.2.1) and (1.2.5) we obtain the savings function below:\n\\[\ns_t^i = \\frac {1+\\gamma - \\beta} {1+\\gamma} [(\\eta_t^iw_t^H + (1- \\eta_t^i )w_t^L + (b_t^i - \\eta_t^iP_t))]  \\tag{1.2.9}\n\\]\nIn this model, investment in education depends on the endowments for educated and uneducated cohorts.

In particular,\n\\[\n\\Biggl(\\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial b_{t}^H}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^L}{\\partial b_t^L}\\Biggl) &gt;0 , \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial Y_{t}} &gt;0 \\Longleftrightarrow p &lt; \\frac {(1-\\alpha)\\lambda}{N_t}, \\frac {\\partial b_{t+1}^H}{\\partial p} &lt; 0.\n\\]\nIn the absence of credit markets for investment in education, education costs have to be covered out of savings from parents,\\(b_t^i\\), which is an intergenerational transfer (or bequest). Therefore, the regression model for investment in education is isomorphic to equation (1.2.10). In this regards, a simple formal function is derived from (1.2.10) as follows:\n\\[\ne_{t+1} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1e_t + \\beta_2y_2 + \\beta_3P_t+ \\xi_i + u_i \\tag{1.2.16}\n\\]\nwhere \\(e_{t+1}\\) indicates the level of education of the next generation, \\(e_t\\) indicates the level of education of the current generation (parents), \\(\\tau y_t\\) is the costs of raising a child (it uses income per capita as proxy), \\(P_t\\) is the cost of investing in human capital for one member of cohort H of generation \\(t\\), \\(\\xi _i\\) reflects household unobserved characteristics, and \\(u_i\\) is an error term."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Medical tourism refers to cross-border movement of people to receive medical, dental or surgical care, driven by affordability, accessibility or better quality of care than is available in the home country or region. It represents a growing market that connects the healthcare, tourism and hospitality industries.\nThe global medical tourism market is estimated at US$38.5-55.0billion based on estimated 11 million cross-border patients and per capita expenditure of US$3500-5000 per visit in 2014. The industry is estimated to grow at 15-25% per annum, faster than any individual economy around the world. The growth of the industry is driven by advances in information-communications technology, decreasing cost of international travels, changes in transnational disease patterns, and asymmetries healthcare industry developments around the world.\nAlthough the industry had existed since ancient times, when ancient Greeks and Egyptians went in search of health-enhancing hot springs and baths, its growth became noticeable in the 18th and 19th centuries when middle-class Europeans and Americans flocked to health spas and sanitariums even in remote places in the hope of finding treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis, gout, bronchitis or liver diseases.\nIn the 20th century, medical tourism was driven prominently by wealthy people traveling from developing countries in search of advanced healthcare in developed countries. However, the 21st century emerging pattern involves travels from more developed countries to less developed countries and within regions in search of affordable treatments.\nMedical tourism is driven by a combination of push and pull factors. Patients in advanced countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada where universal health coverage (or socialized medicine) results in long waiting times for treatment often seek treatment in countries where they would not have to wait; high costs of healthcare in the United States induce patients to seek treatment in countries such as Mexico and India where prices are affordable; immigrants travel back to their home countries to receive care in health systems they are familiar with; expatriates return to countries in which they once lived and arrange care in facilities offering what they regard as high-quality, comparatively low-cost and consumer-oriented treatment; patients in need of medical interventions not approved in home countries (for example stem cell injections of unknown therapeutic effect and risk) travel to countries including China, India and Ukraine where such restrictions are less binding; and others travel overseas for procedures that are illegal in their home countries (for example commercial kidney transplant) to destinations where they are not challenged by laws.\nThe top specialties for medical travelers are cosmetic surgery, dentistry (general, restorative and cosmetic), cardiovascular surgeries (angioplasty, CABG, transplants), orthopedics (joint and spine; sports medicine), cancer treatments (often high-acuity or last resort), reproductive health (fertility, IVF, women’s health), weight loss surgeries (LAP-BAND, gastric bypass) and scans, tests, health screenings and second opinions.\nCurrent top global destinations for medical tourism are Costa Rica, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. In the African region, South Africa and Tunisia are listed as the leading earners from medical tourism. Tourists are attraction to these destinations primarily by advances in healthcare and reputation for clinical excellence, political transparency and commitment to international standards, and the state of tourism infrastructure. Being the primary source of attraction, advances in healthcare are driven by innovations, clinical quality assurance, and improvements in health infrastructure. Both government and private sector investments are critical to these advances.\nDemographics play an overwhelming role in growth and development of medical tourism from both supply and demand sides. The population of top medical tourism destinations are dominated by early-to-mid adults; population age (median years) range between 27 in India and 40 in South Korea.[i] In addition, the top specialties for medical tourism are associated with health consumption of mid-to-late adults.\nCountries with young populations are less likely to have the resources and pressure to develop the kind of health system that is required for the industry; infectious diseases are prominent and are the central emphasis of the health system and health investments in those countries. Similarly, countries with aging populations are less likely to find the space and resources to undertake the essential investments; they are saddled with chronic and degenerative diseases that require the most expensive types of treatment and prolonged care which constitute substantial drains on public investments in needed infrastructure.\nCountries in intermediate but advanced stages of the demographic transition are endowed with dominantly middle-age adult population and have the greatest potentials for medical care exports. While health needs and demands of the population generates the pressure needed to innovate and develop healthcare services at home, their consumption of those services creates the incentives for further innovation and development-focused investments. If the conditions are right, a country with such endowment could generate substantial life cycle savings driven by labor income that could fund substantial investments in infrastructure, while taxation income could support research and innovation. Demographics also play an important role in shaping governance and private sector development. Demand for democratic governance and pressure on governance systems for transparency are significantly strengthened by an energetic adult population. Private sector development is driven by entrepreneurship and innovation that are associated mostly with vibrant early-to-mid adult population.\nIt is estimated that 30,000 Nigerians travel abroad every year for medical care and spend about $1billion in the process, and about a quarter of the sum was spent in India in 2012. Realization of the potential benefits to the economy if such expenditures are retained locally has prompted several reactions including calls for restriction of government sponsorship of public officials and channeling of more resources toward the health sector. The private sector health alliance has recently launched a new initiatives to address management capacity gaps in the health sector in order to stem the tide of these imports. While these initiatives are helpful, it is unclear that they can make substantial impacts on the health system in the absence of a coordinated effort to take a wholesome look at the health sector.\nNigeria is a young country with median population age of 18.2 years. Communicable diseases accounted for 66 percent of deaths in 2014 with non-communicable diseases and injuries making up 24 percent and 10 percent respectively. Thus the epidemiological profile is dominantly infectious, and efforts and resources are currently devoted to prevention and treatment of communicable diseases, among which malaria is predominant. However health service needs will shift toward treatment of non-communicable diseases as the country progresses through the demographic transition. Getting the health system ready to respond to the needs of the changing demographics requires different types of investment. The potential for Nigeria to become a medical tourism earner and reduce import of medical services depends on coordination of efforts to meet the healthcare needs emerging along the demographic transition.\nDeliberate efforts, programs and policies that galvanize both private and public sector resources are needed to create a ready system. While health system infrastructure strengthening, upgrade and development are essential, research, innovations and clinical quality assurance are critical for advancement of the health system and development of medical tourism. Central to these outcomes is a culture of knowledge development through data collection, management, analysis and interpretation, and engagement of decision makers at various levels of the healthcare system, through both operational and policy levels, to use the knowledge and discoveries in making needed changes and implementing proffered solution to existing challenges. The quality of human resources for health depends on the depth of this culture; it is difficult to imagine a system of health training that is more sophisticated than the depth of knowledge generated through its healthcare system.\nNigeria is currently not positioned for medical service export neither can it restrict its import, owing to unfavorable demographics, weak infrastructure, lack of innovation and a poor culture of knowledge development and management. However, demographic conditions would change in near future and present opportunities to develop the export market. The question is whether the health system will be prepared!\n[i] Median age in years for the remaining countries are Costa Rica (30.0), Israel (29.9), Malaysia (27.7), Mexico (27.3), Singapore (33.8), Taiwan (39.2), Thailand (36.2), Turkey (29.6) and the United States (37.8)."

    "text": "There is currently limited evidence, if any, to support the hysteria that emerged out of the first decade of the 21st century, of the prospective dividends of Africa’s growing population, and especially of the youth cohorts. The Africa rising meme has since mellowed as a result of weakening economic growth, due primarily to falling commodity prices, and softening growth prospects.\nEconomic growth in the continent fell from average of 5.4% in 2000-2010 to 3.3% in 2010-2015 compared to global growth of 3.0% and 2.9% during the corresponding periods. The downward trend continued as growth in the region dropped further to 2.2% in 2016. Meanwhile, as population growth slowed in the rest of the world, Africa has continued to experience population boom. Projections indicate that Africa will account for about 60% of global population growth between 2017 and 2050 and be the main contributor to global population thereafter.\nNigeria maintains an outsize influence on the African population and economic growth trajectory. As shown below, the decline in Africa’s economic growth from 3.9% in 2013 to 2.2% in 2016 reflects largely the decline in performance of the Nigeria economy from 5.5% growth in 2013 to 1.5% contraction in 2016. The influence is also noticeable in the projections through 2018 (Figure 1.1).\n\nWith population of 187 million in 2017, Nigeria is currently the 7th most populous country and home to the fastest growing population in the world (2.7% per annum during 2010-2015). As a result, while Africa is recognized to have the youngest population among the world regions, Nigeria’s population is even younger. Children under age 15 account for 44% of Nigeria’s population compared to 41% in Africa, while the share of youths aged 15-19 remains the same at 19%. While a youthful population portends opportunities for demographic dividends, young children create additional burden of economic dependency that constrains potential dividends.\nThe economic benefits of population are dependent primarily on labor markets than any other market. That is, whether a growing population of working age becomes a net benefit or net burden depends primarily on the vibrancy of industry and commerce, and whether the labor force possesses the skills and human capital requirements of the sector.\nIn the absence of social safety nets, more specifically unemployment benefit programs, self-employment and entrepreneurship becomes the viable option for labor force participants unable to secure paid employment in government and organized private sector. Thus, in the absence of productive and competitive education and skills, hard and soft infrastructure essential for channeling financial resources to prospective entrepreneurs, and a friendly entrepreneurship sector, a growing population is essentially a ticking time bomb.\nAlthough evidence shows that Nigeria is already within the demographic window of opportunity, a period during which population can yield substantial economic benefits if the conditions are right, there is no evidence that the country will generate positive demographic dividends under current conditions and the population and development experience.\nThe question on the minds of observers and analysts is how Nigeria can turn its growing population into a force for accelerated growth and development. Among other things, this will require changes in population structure and its geography, growth and productivity. The alternative is to maintain the status quo and look on as the population turns into an economic burden and breeding ground for social unrest, and ultimately a disaster."

    "text": "2.1 Introduction and Purpose\nUnderstanding the epidemiological profile of a territory is necessary to evaluate and address public health needs. Reliable and appropriate health metrics aid policy development, proper health management, evidence-based decision-making, rational resource allocation and monitoring and evaluation of health services and policy. Population health data is becoming an effective and increasingly utilized tool in efforts to treat widespread health problems. Health data has also played an important role in the design and implementation of community-wide health initiatives implemented to promote good health practices. While the demand for health information is increasing in terms of quantity and quality, the response to these needs has been hampered because of fragmentation and major gaps and weaknesses in national health information systems. Insufficient track of epidemiological events has long plagued Sokoto State. Information is poor on progress, success or consequent failure of programs and interventions. As a result, proper health planning and interventions have been stalled affecting the general health welfare of the Sokoto population. In order to fill this breach, accurate and enough informant should be collated and made easily assessible to the general public further enhancing health planning. Failure to this will not only result in public health issues but affect the economic growth of Sokoto state. The present effort is a modest attempt to describe the epidemiological profile of Sokoto from the past and contemporary perspective. This profile will also aid in evaluating the successes achieved as well as caution against the daunting challenges awaiting the state. Variation in the population age structure, altered lifestyles of population attest to the demographic, development and health transition occurring in the state. Population stabilization, life-style modification, surveillance and control of communicable and non-communicable diseases constitute the major challenges demanding urgent attention in the future. The main objective of this project to construct an epidemiological profile, which would serve as a tool to monitor progress of the health of Sokoto, enable efficient program planning and management. Furthermore, this will provide the information needed by health policy and decision-makers. The public health issues facing the states are presented in the following sections: communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, injuries and accidents and other important health information. Each section focuses on analyzing past as well as current situations, providing policymakers with evidence and forecasts for planning."

    "text": "2.2 Data Sources\nPrimarily, the main sources of the data presented in the report are from the WHO and UN agency databases which in turn, rely on surveys as their primary sources: Demographic and health surveys (DHS), Multiple indicator cluster surveys (MICS), Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS), National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHS) and Standardized monitoring and assessment of relief and transitions (SMART) surveys. Information on indicators that are not collected in routine surveys was obtained from modelled estimates available from public sources (such as, the National Bureau of Statistics), status reports, and reviews, journal publications. Health data on Sokoto state are difficult to assess and often unavailable. When unavailable, assumptions were made based on recommended standards.\nMajor causes of mortality in Sokoto State (2016) was estimated to assess disease impact to the population. To obtain a proper representation of various mortality factors and their corresponding effects, it became pertinent to describe Sokoto’s mortality profile with a proportional mortality; a ratio of individual mortality cause to the total mortality, showing the percentage each disease contributed. [1]. Sokoto’s proportional mortaility was computed based on data from the Sokoto State Health Strategic plan (HHSP-II) of 2016 [2] . In addition, some assumptions were made based on experts’ opinion and WHO standards for missing data. Death from several diseases were then expressed as a ratio of the total death in Sokoto. The proportions were represented as percentages. An Excel template was created to capture prevalence and incidence data for indicators discussed."

    "text": "2.3 State Context\nSokoto State is located in the extreme northwest of Nigeria, and subdivided into 23 local government areas (LGAs). The State covers a land area of approximately 27,825 square kilometers, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills has its topography dominated by a rolling peneplain [3,4]. The state experiences its rainy season from June to October, with cold and dry north eastern winds known as the “Harmattan” occurring frequently from December through March [5] . The economic activity in Sokoto is agriculture, in addition to exploitation of natural resources. More than 90% of the population engaged in subsistence farming [5] . The state is one of the fish producing areas of the country, thus, many people along the river basins engage in fishing activities. Large-scale farming is practiced in the State using irrigation water. There are all kinds of animals both wild and domestic in the State. Sokoto ranks second in livestock production in the country with animal population of well over 8 million. Minerals such as Kaolin, Gypsum limestone, laterite, Red mills, Phosphate, both yellow and green shade clay, sand etc. are available in the State in commercial quantities. The availability of these economic potentials provides good investment opportunities, particularly in agro-allied industries such as flour mills, tomato processing, sugar refining, textiles, glue, tanning, fish canning and dairy.\nThe Sokoto State Ministry of Health (SMOH), like other Nigerian states, has overall responsibility for the health sector. The State Ministry of Health is responsible for advising government on policy formulation, regulation and implementation of health and health related issues in the state. Organization of the health delivery system in Sokoto State conforms to a three-tiered system: tertiary, secondary and primary level care. The people of the state are majorly Muslims and Islam provides them with code of conduct that influences their day-to-day activities, such as the emphasis on cleanliness in all aspects of life. Hence, in Sokoto state, there are strict injunctions regarding private and public hygiene derived from their Islamic law, which if applied will improve overall well-being of dwellers [6]."

    "section": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases",
    "text": "4.1 Infectious and Parasitic Diseases\nDiseases Communicable diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens that people spread to one another through contact with contaminated surfaces, bodily fluids, blood products, insect bites, or through the air [14]. Most common forms of spread include fecal-oral, food, sexual intercourse, insect bites, contact with contaminated fomites, droplets, or skin contact. Some of the leading communicable disease in Nigeria include HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, malaria, meningitis, diarrheal diseases, syphilis and lower respiratory tract infections [15]. Regarding CDs in general, the interplay of agent, host and environment factors lead to a dynamic state of health and disease. New or emerging illnesses are often caused by organisms already in the environment and which become infectious due to altered conditions in the ecology[9]. This occurrence could be as a result of poor hygiene and unsafe sanitation (e.g. open defecation by adult and unhygienic disposal of children feces-a prevalent practice), poor utilization of health personnel for maternal health care (In 2011, 87.7% pregnant women aged 15-49 years used their homes for delivery whilst 11.7% and 0.6% visited public and private health facilities) which are major risk factors especially in rural communities in Sokoto State [16].\nCommunicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto state [8]. Sokoto state has long been plagued by communicable diseases notably: malaria, leprosy, dysentery, measles, gonorrhea, whooping cough, HIV and meningitis as far back as the nineties tetanus [8]. Based on the proportional mortality that was estimated (2016), CDs along with maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions in Sokoto State accounted for an estimated 73% of all deaths - a high figure especially in contrast with developed countries (deaths due to communicable diseases in the United States of America was 5% only in 2016) [17]. Common communicable diseases plaguing Sokoto state are discussed below:\n\n4.1.1 HIV/AIDS\nThe first case of AIDS was reported in Nigeria in 1986. The current national prevalence of HIV is estimated at 1.4% (15-49 years), with a total estimated 1.9 million persons living with HIV in Nigeria [18]. Prevalence among females is significantly higher at an estimated 1.9%, with male prevalence estimated at 0.9% [18]. In 2014, about 136,833 people were living with HIV (PLWHIV) in Sokoto out of a projected population of about 5 million [19].\nHIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto has fluctuated substantially over the years. The first HIV Sentinel Survey in 1991 showed a prevalence of 1.8% [20]. Subsequent sentinel surveys produced prevalence of 1.6% (1993), 2.7% (1999), 2.8% (2001), 4.5% (2003), 3.2% (2005), 6.0% (2008) and 3.3% (2010) [19]. Based on the recent National Aids Indicator Survey (2018), HIV/AIDS prevalence in Sokoto state is estimated to have reduced to 0.4% (15-49) years in 2018; making them one of the low prevalence states in Nigeria with a disease burden of 12,844 approximately 0.013% of the burden in low prevalence states [18].\n\n\n\nFigure 3. HIV Prevalence Trends in Sokoto state (1991-2018). Source: Nigeria ANC Surveillance Report 2010; National Aids Indicator Survey, 2019.\n\n\nNew infections are primarily from key populations , especially female sex workers and their partners in the general population [18]. The HIV prevalence in the urban areas is lower than the rural areas in Sokoto State. In these rural towns and villages, risk is driven by variations in sexual behaviors such as casual, transactional and sex work; with female sex workers ranking high as the source of new infections Beyond behavioral risk factors, environmental and systemic factors also constitute risks for HIV infection. Transfusion of infected blood and blood products and poor handling and disposal of highly infectious wastes generated in healthcare settings increase the risk for HIV transmission [18].\nIn addition, other structural drivers play a role in the HIV epidemic in Sokoto. These include those socio-cultural factors that increase people’s vulnerability to HIV infection such as: poverty, gender inequality-inability of women to demand condom use due to male dominance over women’s reproductive rights, extra-marital sex and/or multiple sex partners, female genital mutilation and levirate marriage (Widow Inheritance), disempowering women from seeking HIV prevention or treatment services without the permission of their husbands/partners, human rights violations and the persistence of HIV and AIDS- related stigma and discrimination [18].\nMortality due to AIDS in Sokoto have considerably reduced over the years. This decreased by 14% from 2016-2018. As at 2016, AIDS death contributes to 2 percent only of the total mortality rates in Sokoto State. [2]. This accomplishment might as well be credited to successful intervention programs.\n\n\n4.1.2 Tuberculosis\nSeveral infectious diseases once considered to be controlled have re-emerged to become major public health problems of a greater magnitude than was previously the case; tuberculosis is one of such. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium spp. There are two types of human tuberculosis: Pulmonary and Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. A study conducted to determine the species of Mycobacterium involved in cases of human tuberculosis in Sokoto State indicated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (69.23%) has remained the major causative organism causing tuberculosis in Sokoto, followed by Mycobacterium bovis (20.51%) and finally the atypical mycobacterium (10.26%) [21].\nIn 2006, a total of 1,383 of all forms of cases were registered out of which 92% (1,265) tested sputum smear positive [22]. However, this increased to 3,329 in 2013 with 67% (2,170) testing sputum smear positive. The rate of relapse remained fluctuating from 2009-2013. Nevertheless, the number of failed treatment cases reduced by 1% (2008-2013) [23]. Individuals within the age group of 25-34 years had the highest infection rate while those within the age group of 0-14 years had the least infection. Overall, males were affected more than females probably as a result of high exposure. The number of Direct Observed Treatment Short course centers (DOTS) increased progressively from 2008 to 2013 which improved treatment access to TB patients. Hence, DOTS can be credited to be one of factors resulting to a reduction in the total number of cases rate [23].\nNigeria has a high degree of overlap between HIV and TB infected population among 15-49 years age group. The recorded HIV prevalence among TB patients has risen from 2.2% in 1991 to 19.1% in 2001 and an estimated 27% in 2003 [24]. The TB/HIV co-infection rate of 27%, suggests that about 800,000 persons have both HIV and TB infection. At this rate, an additional burden of 50,000 TB cases annually is added from the HIV infected people [25]. Prevalence rates of HIV, HBsAg and HCV among TB patients vary from region to region in Nigeria. In 2016, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was 5.6% (2.2% female and 3.3% male) in Sokoto State. The female to male ratio of TB patients was 1:2.9, while the ratio of co-infection of HIV among TB patients for female to male was 1:1.5 [26]. Co-infection occurred in age range of 21-40 years only, with age group 31 – 40 years having the highest prevalence of co-infection [26]. This high prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients was observed in younger sexually active age group. In 2018, the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients increased to 16.3%. Prevalence of HBsAg and HCV among TB patients was 14.9% and 5.4% respectively [27]. In addition, prevalence of co-infection of HIV-HBsAg-HCV in TB patients was 1.45% in 2018 [27]. The causes of HIV-HBV-HCV co-infection has been associated with parenteral, sexual and vertical transmission, and sharing of injections by injection drug users.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Leprosy is curable and early treatment averts most disabilities [28]. Cases of leprosy are usually classified as either paucibacillary leprosy (PB) or multibacillary leprosy (MB). This classification is based on counting the number of skin lesions and is primarily used for the purposes of chemotherapy, as PB cases are treated for 6 months and MB cases for 12 months using different regimens [29].\nBefore 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy endemic countries in the world. Surveys in the 1940s and 1950s found prevalence rates ranging from 16-390 per 10,000. In 1991, country wide leprosy prevalence rate of 30.3 per 10,000 was estimated [30]. Although Nigeria achieved the targeted prevalence level for the elimination of leprosy before the year 2000 and attained low endemicity to a large extent, incidences have still being noted since then [30].\nLeprosy cases in Sokoto dropped by approximately 76% from 2006 to 2013 (with a total registered case of 263 in 2006 and 63 in 2013) [23]. This can be attributed to the success of the Multi-drug therapy introduced to Nigeria in 1985 and launched with the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control Program (NTBLCP) in 1991 together with the discharge of inactive or wrongly diagnosed patients, adoption of the WHO 12-month MB treatment regimen and massive discharge of all patients on the former 24-month regimen that had received more than 12 doses [30].\nIn 2009, 225 leprosy cases registered, 62% (139) were males including children and adults whilst 38% were females (86). This however declined to 86 registered cases in 2013; 73% males and 27% females . Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age. In 2009 about 7.5% of children were affected by leprosy among all the registered cases [31], which increased to 19% of children in 2011 [32] but declined slightly to 15% of children in the year 2013-indicating a high level of leprosy transmission [23]. The pre-dominant type of leprosy in Sokoto state is the MB while lesser cases of leprosy is the PB. MB proportion increased progressively from 91% in 2009 to all forms of leprosy cases falling into the MB classification by 2013, implying longer treatment regimens for patients as well as increased risk of transmission since MB is commonly classified as the infectious leprosy [30].\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Trend of Registered Leprosy cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Tuberculosis and Control Program, 2009-2013.\n\n\nThe WHO disability leprosy grading system has been in use for years. Its main application has been used as an indicator for early case detection/reporting [33]. This grading system varies from 0 to 2; with 2 being the most severe. The rate of WHO Grade 2 disability decreased significantly from 19% to 9% during a one-year interval from 2011-2012. This falling disability rate indicates that new cases were increasingly diagnosed before they developed visible deformities. Thus, representing an improved promptness in case detection. Crude death rate due to leprosy has being fluctuating from 4.7 per 100,000 in 2010, 3.1 per 100, 000 in 2011 and 5.5 per 100,000 in 2012. This variation in the number of deaths may be indicative of an unstable treatment regimen. Efforts ought to be put in place to ensure this is effective [23,31,32].\n\n\n4.1.4 Malaria\nMalaria accounts for 40% of public health expenditure. 30 - 50% of in-patient admissions and up to 50% of out-patient visits in areas with high malaria transmission [34]. Malaria is endemic throughout Nigeria with seasonal variation in different geographic zones of the country. More than 90% of the total population is at risk of malaria and at least 50% of the population suffers from at least one episode of malaria each year [35]. Malaria has long plagued Sokoto State like other Nigerian states. However, there have been improvements over the years. This may be as a result of three major control interventions: insecticide treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) [36].\nGender-specific infection rate in Sokoto showed that males had the higher infection rate than females. There are no scientific facts to explain this phenomenon, however, suggestions have been made that this high prevalence rate could just be by chance, or due to the fact that males engage in activities which make them more prone to infective mosquito bites in comparison to their female counterparts, that are mostly at home and protected from such infective bites [35]. The age group 0 - 5 years had the highest infection rate followed by 6 - 10 and 11 - 15 years age groups [35]. Among children aged 6-59 months with malaria parasites, the dominant species of malaria parasites is Plasmodium falciparum specie (&gt;90%) with P. malaria playing a minor role [37].\nMalaria prevalence among children under 5 was measured in the 2015 National Malaria Indicator Survey (NMIS) and 66% of the children tested positive for malaria when RDTs were used to detect the presence of parasites while 46.6% tested positive when microscopy was used. The prevalence is higher with RDTs than with microscopy as expected because false positive test results are possible with RDTs [37]. This have been proven true by other studies, which have shown a higher prevalence of malaria using RDTs instead of microscopy [38,39].\nThe percentage of children with malaria is much higher in rural than in urban areas [37] as a result of poor environmental sanitation, which provides adequate breeding sites for the malaria parasite. Malaria prevalence decreases as the mother’s education level and wealth quintile status increase; which could be as a result of knowledge of preventive measures to malaria infection and access to cleaner as well as safer environs [37].\nUse of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is one of the most effective measures used to prevent malaria. Between May 2009 and November 2013, the government of Nigeria, with support from several partners, distributed approximately 52 million mosquito nets across the country. Overall in Sokoto (2015), 79% of households had at least one mosquito net, 77% had at least one ITN, and 77% percent had at least one LLIN. By 2018, 84% of households having at least one mosquito net, an average number of two ITNs per household and 39% having at least one net for every two persons in the household. [7]. Rural households are more likely to own at least one ITN than urban households [11].\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Malaria cases in Sokoto State. Source: National Bureau Statistics, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Malaria Deaths in Sokoto State (2006-2016). Source: WHO Global Malaria Program Estimates, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Diarrhea\nEach year, an estimated 2.5 billion cases of diarrhea occur among children under five years of age, and estimates suggest that overall incidence has remained relatively stable over the past two decades, more than half of these cases are in Africa and South Asia, where bouts of diarrhea are more likely to result in death or other severe outcome . Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children in Nigeria; responsible for about 16% of child’s death every year. Nigeria was estimated to have a total number of annual child deaths due to diarrhea to be 151,700 [40].\nRotavirus has been identified among the most important cause of infantile diarrhea especially in developing countries. Reports have shown that 39% of diarrhea episodes seen at health centers were rotavirus positive . In 2015, the prevalence of rotavirus diarrhea accounted for 25.5% of diarrhea cases among children younger than five years of age presented to hospitals in Sokoto metropolis [41]. In Sokoto, diarrhea is most common among children age 12–23 months and least common among those age 48-59 months. Diarrhea with blood was also most common in children aged 12-23 months. Children of mothers with no education were twice as likely as children of mothers with more than a secondary education to have had diarrhea [42].\n\n\n\nFigure 9. Diarrhea prevalence in children under five 2008-2013. Source: NDHS, 2013\n\n\n\n\n4.1.6 Schistosomiasis\nAbout 252 million individuals might be affected worldwide with the disease [43]. Globally, the disease is on the increase in both prevalence and incidence because of the expansion of irrigated agriculture which provides habitats for vector snails; construction of hydro-electricity generating sites; lack of good sanitary habits; and lack of safe water for the growing population [44]. In Nigeria, three species are pathogenic to man: S. haematobium, S. mansoni and S. intercalatum [45].\nBoth intestinal and urinogenital schistosomiasis occur in Nigeria. Previous research has documented prevalence rates between 14.2% and 91.4% [46,47]. Schistosomiasis is typically more prevalent in children than adults. In a study, findings revealed that males within the age group 10-14 years recorded highest prevalence than females. Perhaps, as a result of frequent water contact by males in cercariae infested areas around the river [48].\nIn 2016, the prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis (children) in Sokoto state was 60.80% and 2.93% for intestinal schistosomiasis. The prevalence of the infection by water contact activities showed that children who were involved in farming and children who swim and fish had the highest and second-highest rates respectively. Likewise, those who contact river and dam water for bathing, fetching and washing had similar pattern [45]. Children whose source of drinking water were dams, ponds and rivers had the highest prevalence in contrast with children that drink water from wells and boreholes- with the least prevalence.\nPrevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis is low, which may be because intestinal schistosomiasis is transmitted by Biomphalaria sps. of snails, whose presence is very low-slung in northern Nigerian regions. In contrast, high prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis may be attributed to high occurrence of vector snails of Bulinus sps. in the local water bodies of northern Nigeria [49] and high dependence on untreated water from natural water (especially amongst rural dwellers) where infection may set in, since schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and frequent contact of the population with fresh water may lead to high infection rates and constant re-infection [45].\n\n\n\nFigure 10. Schistosomiasis prevalence in children Source: Kabiru et al., 2013.\n\n\n\n\n4.1.7 Polio\nNigeria is a major reservoir of poliovirus in the world and until recently the only country with ongoing transmission of all three serotypes namely: wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3), and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Nigeria is one of the three remaining endemic countries. As at 2005, Nigeria was responsible for about half of the global burden of polio [50].\nEnvironmental surveillance has repeatedly detected cVDPVs in Sokoto since mid-2013. An Environmental sampling conducted during 2014 detected 16 cVDPV2 in Sokoto [51]. The last reported case of poliomyelitis due to wild poliovirus type 2 was reported in 1999 and wild poliovirus type 2 was officially certified as eradicated in September 2015 [52]. In Sokoto State, four genetically related viruses were isolated from four environmental samples collected between 24 April and 9 May 2018; no associated case of acute flaccid paralysis has been detected, as the virus was isolated only from environmental samples. In October 2016, an unrelated circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) outbreak and subsequently Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV2) events occurred in Sokoto State [53].\nNigeria mounted a massive vaccine response with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV), Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine (mOPV2) and Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), even surpassing outbreak guidelines. However, Vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) has persisted in Sokoto [54]. This indicates that there is a high number of unimmunized children which threaten to sustain transmission. Improving the quality and oversight of the Sokoto program is an urgent priority to head off a resurgence of Type 2 disease nation-wide, particularly as immunity levels drop following the withdrawal of Trivalent oral polio vaccine and continued weak routine immunization [54]. However, the polio eradication program over the years have proven somewhat successful. 21st August 2019 marks three years since Nigeria last reported a case of wild poliovirus. This is an important public health milestone for the country and the entire Africa Region, with a step closer to being certified as polio-free [53].\n\n\n4.1.8 Meningitis\nCerebrospinal meningitis is a major public health problem still affecting tropical countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. It is highly contagious and mortality from the disease remains high, despite major achievements in the treatment modalities. Outbreaks of Neisseria Meningitides (Nm) type C has been on the increase since 2013 in Sokoto state in Northwest, Nigeria. Eight hundred and fifty-six (856) cases were reported in Sokoto state in 2013 with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 6.8%. The 2015 figure gives an alarming 5-fold rise in the number of cases seen compared to that of 2014. This implies it could get worse in subsequent years if no public health measures are put in place to stop the trend [55]."

    "text": "4.2 Maternal & Reproductive Health\n\n4.2.1 Maternal Health\nThree-quarters of all maternal deaths occur during delivery and immediate post-partum period. The single most critical intervention for safe motherhood is to ensure a competent health worker with mid-wifery skill is present at every birth [56]. A world fit for children goal is to ensure that women have ready and available access to skilled attendance at delivery. The indicators include the proportion of births with a skilled attendant and proportion of institutional deliveries. About 7.4% of births occurring in 2011 (Sokoto) were delivered by skilled personnel (2.5% Doctor, 4.9% Nurses and Mid-Wife). This increased to 20.6% in 2017 (7.7% doctors, 12.9% Nurses and Mid-Wives) [56].\nIncreasing the proportion of births that are delivered in health facilities is an important factor in reducing the health risks to both the mother and the baby. Proper medical attention and hygienic conditions during delivery can reduce the risks of complications and infections that can cause morbidity and mortality to either the mother or the baby. A large percentage of pregnant women in Sokoto deliver in their respective homes- 92.6% in 2011. However, a decrease to 87.7% was noted in 2017, with the rest delivery occurring in health facilities (Public and Private Facilities) [56].\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Causes of Maternal Deaths Sokoto - 2016. Source: Sokoto State Health Development Plan-II, 2016\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Vesico-vaginal Fistula\nVesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) is a devastating and debilitating condition which profoundly hampers the quality of life of women. Despite improvement in health care delivery systems and advancement in surgical techniques, VVF continues to be a major health problem [57]. Predisposing factors to obstetric fistula include early age at delivery, home delivery, early marriage, obstructed labor, unskilled birth attendant, economic and socio-cultural factors among others.\nProlonged obstructed labor is the main cause of obstetric fistula in developing countries, Nigeria inclusive at 96.5% [58]. It is a preventable and treatable disease commonly found among the poor population- young women and illiterate girls, who mainly live in the rural communities with difficulty in accessing emergency obstetric care and areas with limited or under-utilized skilled birth attendants [58]. Most of the vesicovaginal fistula patients in northern Nigeria had early marriages: 93.6% of Sokoto patients were married before or at 18 years of age [59]."

    "text": "4.3 Nutritional Deficiencies\nNutrition plays an essential component in the evaluation of a child’s growth and health. Children’s physical development is an important indicator of a society’s welfare. It reflects socioeconomic, food safety and environmental conditions [60]. The living conditions (i.e., socioeconomic, nutritional and environmental) to which children are exposed, influences their optimal growth potential [61]. Child malnutrition indicators are typically classified into: Acute Malnutrition, Underweight, Stunting and Overweight.\n\n4.3.1 Acute malnutrition (AM)\nAcute Malnutrition7 in children (6-59 months) is either moderate or severe. Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)8 is an important indicator and the most dangerous form of malnutrition and closely linked to mortality risk [62]. A child with SAM has 9-fold increased risk of death compared to a child with no acute malnutrition [63]. Sokoto state had 9.8% Global Acute Malnutrition9 (GAM) and 1.0% Severe Acute Malnutrition coefficient in 2018, compared to its GAM of 10.5% and SAM of 2.4% in 2015, a slight change [62]. The estimates show a poor nutrition situation according to WHO classification of GAM rate of 5-9.9%. Sokoto has the fourth highest state prevalence in GAM and SAM of 8.4% and 2.0% respectively, evincing reflecting a poor nutritional status of the state. In 2015, Sokoto was above the warning threshold for GAM (10 &lt; GAM &lt;15) and WHO SAM crisis threshold of 2 percent [62].\nThe causes of malnutrition and food insecurity are multifaceted and include poor infant and young child feeding practices, which contribute to high rates of illness and poor nutrition among children under 2 years; lack of access to healthcare, water, and sanitation; armed conflict, particularly in the north; irregular rainfall; high unemployment; and poverty. Although chronic and seasonal food insecurity occurs throughout the country and is exacerbated by volatile and rising food prices, the impact of conflict and other shocks has resulted in acute levels of food insecurity.

    "section": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases",
    "text": "4.4 Noncommunicable Diseases\nNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death globally, and one of the major health challenges of the 21st century. In 2016, they were responsible for 71% (41 million) of the 57 million deaths which occurred globally [64]. Non-communicable diseases are characterized as that which is non-infectious and of chronic nature. These include diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mental disorders, neuro-degenerative disorders and injuries [65]. In the current global health context, ‘NCDs’ mainly refer to four diseases – diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic respiratory disease [65]. Nigeria is currently witnessing both demographic and epidemiologic transitions, which could be some of the possible reasons why the prevalence of non-communicable diseases is increasing [66].\nIn Nigeria, research by WHO in 2016 shows that NCDs were estimated to account for 29% of all deaths (Cardiovascular diseases 11%, cancer 4%, diabetes 1%) [17]. Similar to the national pattern, NCDs less cancer was estimated to account for 21% of all deaths in Sokoto (Cardio vascular diseases 10%, Diabetes 2%) [2]. Though communicable diseases remain the primary cause of death in Sokoto, the state is currently facing an increase in the burden of NCDs. The costs on society will therefore be staggering; the burden on the health system will be increasingly unsustainable, the loss from the workforce of adults in their prime will have profound effects on the fiscus and families, and communities will struggle to make ends meet. All these of course, is likely to be made worse by a rising population [67].\nThe focus of the health sector in most countries had been almost exclusively on healthcare services. However, because NCD risk factors lie in sectors beyond health, the key strategy to curb this rise is to use a multisectoral approach. Different sectors have different contributions to make towards solving this problem. Inability to curb this will lead to a bigger challenge future wise. Currently, NCDs contribute to 88% of all deaths in the USA (2016) -a huge burden yet to be tackled [17]\n\n4.4.1 Diabetes\nDiabetes mellitus (DM) was previously considered to be rare in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the prevalence is on the increase mainly because of urbanization and changes in lifestyle [68]. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing worldwide, and it is projected that by the year 2030 over 500 million adults will be affected by DM [69]. These large increases are predicted to occur mostly in developing countries and in adults especially between 45 and 64 years of age due to changes in lifestyles especially diet and physical inactivity [70]. These predictions indicate a growing burden of diabetes, particularly in developing countries. In 2011, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was about 2.7% in Nigeria [71].\nThe prevalence rate of 4.3% for DM in Sokoto was noted in 2017 amongst sub-urban dwellers [68]. The prevalence was slightly higher in men than women (4.5% vs. 4.0%) and differed significantly according to weight status or Body Mass Index classification. Prevalence of DM is still lower in rural (0.8%) than urban. This low prevalence of DM among rural dwellers could be attributed to the complementary traditional lifestyle, which depends on animal husbandry and subsistence economy [72]. The prevalence of DM increases with advancing age, a finding that is consistent with previous studies .\nWith respect to other blood sugar disorders, there was a relatively high prevalence of prediabetes defined as Impaired fasting glycemia (IFG) or Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) among a rural Fulani community in Wamakko Local Government area of Sokoto state [73]. The prevalence rates of IGT and IFG were 8 and 6.9% respectively This relatively high prevalence of IGT is similar to International Diabetes Federation estimates of about 8% prevalence rate for IGT in Nigeria [73] In urbanized Fulani, prevalence of 14.6% of IGT was recorded [74]. This is attributable to lifestyle changes associated with urbanization. Urban lifestyle in Africa is characterized by changes in dietary habits involving an increase in the consumption of refined sugars, saturated fat, and reduction in fiber intake [75]. Urbanization tends to decrease physical activity as very little physical activity is required for daily living whereas rural populations rely on foot walk as transportation means and often have intense agricultural activities as their main occupation [72].\n\n\n4.4.2 Cancer\nCancer is a public health problem worldwide affecting all ages. It is the second commonest cause of death in developed countries and among the three leading causes of death in developing countries. WHO reported that about 24.6 million people live with cancer world-wide. There are 12.5% of all deaths attributable to cancer and if the trend continues, it is estimated that by 2020, 16 million new cases will be diagnosed per annum out of which 70% will be in the developing countries [76]. Cancer is an emerging non-communicable disease in sub-Sahara Africa. The pattern of cancer distribution in developed and sub-Saharan Africa vary significantly. While lung, breast, prostate, colorectal and urinary bladder carry more than 50% of cancer burden in Europe and America; the Sub-Saharan African region showed that breast, cervical, prostate, Lymphomas, gastrointestinal cancers carry more than 60% of cancer burden [77].\nAmong males in Sokoto state, the five most frequently reported cancers are bladder cancer (19.3%), prostate (9.9%) and non- hodgkin’s lymphoma (6.5%). The most frequent sites of cancers in females by rank order are breast (25.3%), followed by cervix uteri (14.1%) and ovary (5.6%). Almost half of the breast cancers were diagnosed in premenopausal women (in the 30-49 years age group), while cervical cancer tended to affect women a decade later. Significantly, bladder cancer did not appear to be frequent in females [78].\n\n\n4.4.3 Cardiovascular Diseases\nCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries and they are emerging as prominent public health problems in developing countries.\nThe prevalence of CVD in Sokoto (2009) was 52.60% in males and 47.40% in females [79] . The highest incidence of CVD was seen between the age ranges of 40-49 years while the lowest incidence was seen between the age ranges of 19 years. Hypertension, closely followed by stroke, is the most prevalent CVD while Chronic Heart Disease (CHD) is the least prevalent CVD in Sokoto Prevalence of hypertension (2017) was 23.6%. There is an age-related increase in the prevalence of hypertension. This is not surprising as blood pressure tends to rise with age and hence the possibility of a greater burden of hypertension as people live longer. The potential impact is the additional stretching of health resources, which is already failing the stress utilization test [80].\nCigarette smoking of any amount, elevated blood pressure, elevated serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), low serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), diabetes mellitus, and advancing age have been identified as the major and independent risk factors for Chronic Heart Diseases (CHD). In 2017, the prevalence of dyslipidemia, total cholesterol and cigarette smoking in Sokoto was 3.5%, 6% and 7% respectively. These values are low possibly reflecting the low level of cholesterol in diet of most the people and nature of our occupation such as farming and transport system that force resident to engage in physical activity most at times strenuous [80]. Hypertension had the highest occurrence of mortality of all the CVD’s 30.85% while congenital heart disease had the lowest number of deaths 0.56% [79].\n\n\n4.4.4 Obesity\nObesity is a non-communicable medical disorder that has largely been accepted as reflection of healthy living and affluence among Nigerians. It is usually defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m 2 and is assuming an epidemic dimension [19].\nIn 2014, the prevalence rate of generalized obesity was 13.9% of which 1.7% had BMI&gt;40 kg/m 230.6% (11.4% in men and 19.2% in women), which was lower than the national prevalence rate observed in 2008 [66]. The higher rate of obesity in females may be related to their sedentary lifestyle in this part of country as many are full house wives, while males are more involved in physical activities arising from their farming occupations [80].\n\n\n4.4.5 Drug Use In Sokoto State\nIn 2017, prevalence of any drug use in Nigeria was estimated at 14.4% or 14.3 million people aged between 15 and 64 years. The extent of drug use in Nigeria is comparatively high when compared with the 2016 global annual prevalence of any drug use of 5.6% among the adult population . People who inject drugs constitute a sizeable proportion of high-risk drug users in Nigeria. The most common drugs injected in the past year were pharmaceutical opioids, followed by cocaine and heroin. While overall, more men were injecting drugs, women were more likely than men to report injecting heroin. The extent of risky injecting practices and sexual behaviors among the high-risk drug users and those who inject drugs is also of concern as is the extent of self-reported HIV among this group. Women who injected drugs were more likely than men to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors further compounding their risk for acquiring HIV among other infections [16]\n\n\n\nFigure 12.

The use of cannabis and non-medical use of opioids (tramadol, codeine, morphine) and cough syrups (containing codeine or dextromethorphan) are also the most common in this zone [16]. A qualitative study was conducted to examine the abuse of cough syrup as a new trend in drug abuse among the youth in five (5) Northwestern States of Nigeria. The results show that 33% claimed to source the substances from chemists and pharmacies, 36% claimed to acquire the substance from Drug dealers (retail), while 23% claimed they obtained the substance from Drug dealers (Wholesale) [81]."

This is more so in the developing countries like Nigeria where increasing industrialization, high velocity vehicles, increasing ethno-religious clashes and recently widespread terrorist attacks have resulted in sudden, unexpected mass casualties presenting to secondary and/or tertiary health centers [82].\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Mortality and Morbidity rates of RTA (2010-2013). Source: National Bureau of Statistics, 2014\n\n\nThe number of deaths as a result of road traffic accidents increased by 6.2% (2010-2013) with a simultaneous increase to 2.2% injured persons within the same time interval [83]. This could be as a result of flouting traffic rules and regulations, poor use of seat belts by motorists, outright refusal to use seat belts and an influx of alternatives to vehicles such as motorcycles and tricycles. Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALWs) enable and extend violence which has enormous public health consequences too. Within a ten-year interval of 2003-2013, Sokoto state had a prevalence of 0.07% SALWs, with 14% fatality, and peak age range of 26–35 years being affected. The most common types of injuries were wounds, systemic organ injuries and fractures. Brain trauma, though not very common had 75% mortality while systemic organ injury had 24.6% mortality [84]."

    "text": "In a general sense, science and technology refers to the production and application of new knowledge for development. It is the main driver of transformation in every sphere of society, be it economic, social, or political. Advances in science and technology capabilities are at the heart of economic, demographic, and environmental differences between the developed and developing countries. Indeed, no nation can dream of development without science and technology.\nAt its 44th session in 1989, the United Nations’ General Assembly noted “with great concern that the effect of increasing disparities in scientific and technological capabilities between the industrialized and the developing countries as a whole has been to contribute to a widening of the economic gap between them.”1 Indeed, this acknowledgment dates back to the creation of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) in 1931 and has subsequently been essential to the programs and conferences of the United Nations (UN) after its creation in 1945. Early efforts to facilitate the application of science and technology in the less developed countries began with the New York scientific conference on the conservation and utilization of resources in 1949, and continued through the Geneva conference on the application of science and technology for the benefit of the less developed areas in 1963, as well as the Vienna conference on science and technology for development in 1979.\nDespite a few, very notable successes in scientific and technological (S&T) output that have been produced within the continent of Africa, it is clear that S&T production is heavily based elsewhere, largely in the global north. One can cite most metrics on the issue to support this characterization, e.g. number of patents registered, scientific journal article submitted, etc. Increasingly, there is an consensus among Africans and Africanists that the continent cannot grow economically without redressing this imbalance. In order to do so, one would do well by understanding the root causes for the poor performance of many African countries in this regard."

    "section": "Why doesn’t Africa produce more S&T?",
    "text": "Why doesn’t Africa produce more S&T?\nA number of factors underlie Africa’s low level of S&T production. Many also underlie the continent’s low level of development generally, including its colonial history, its generally poor governance, its high rate of conflict, etc. By and large, these ‘macro-factors’ will be given short-shrift in this paper.2 In their place, issue more specific to S&T production will be the focus. In particular, since the responsibility for S&T production (and development, more generally) lies squarely on the shoulders of African governments, the issues and decisions they face will assume an elevated importance.\nOn paper, it might appear that African government do a great deal to promulgate the S&T agenda. Countries have issued a number of statements attesting to their commitment to the cause; they have signed treaties like the Lagos Plan of Action, the Abuja Treaty and most recently the Consolidated Plan of Action, etc; they instituted entire ministries tasked with promoting S&T. The reality, however, is quite different than the formal proclamations and rhetoric might suggest. On the whole, African governments do little to prioritize S&T research and its application. The ministries charged with this role are typically minor players in their national governments; they are considered to have relatively low importance and are underfunded accordingly. Other countries lack S&T ministries altogether or have policies that were created a generation ago and geared towards a context which no longer applies.3\nUnder-attention of the issue and the under-resourcing of the actors meant to address has lead to a relatively greater foreign influence in the matter. Foreign donors have be able to drive their own S&T agenda, and often, they emphasized ‘technology transfer’ as a key component of their modus operandi. The idea—which dominated the African independence era of the 1960s and has had lingering effects thereafter—was that the existing stock of scientific knowledge required for economic progress existed in the developed countries and simply needed to be transmitted to the developing countries in order for them to develop. This attitude almost systematically neglected the importance of the building-up of local S&T capacity and local ownership of S&T projects.\nThe consequences were, to a large degree, negative. A sense of ‘knowledge dependence’ in Africa has resulted, and, decades after independence, African countries are still largely reliant on the importation of Western technology. Making matters worse, African countries exercise relatively little control in using imported technology towards their own stated aims. Ogbu (2002, 2) expressed this sentiment succinctly by noting:\nThere is a certain unwitting acceptance of technological determinism among Africans, certainly among many African policy makers. Their tendency is to treat technology as manna from heaven. The technology does not have a social context. And, that the impacts or effects of technology are determined by the technology itself. Yet we know that the direction of development and impacts of any given technology are shaped by social and economic forces embedded in well-crafted science and technology policies.\nOne manifestation of this ‘lack of control’ has been a disconnect between S&T research and the private sector industry which could benefit from its knowledge.4 For instance, Africa continues to predominantly export primary commodities—like oil, natural gas and minerals—as opposed to products with more ‘value-added’ to them which require a higher level of S&T sophistication. African development writ large suffers as a result.\nThis policy paper will address a series of interrelated issues. Most prominently, it will ask: why has the Science and Technology agenda not taken off in many African countries, as it has in many non-African countries? In answering this question, a set of seven African and seven non-African countries will be used as case studies (the methodology behind their selection will be addressed in a later chapter.) Both quantitative and more qualitative, historical data will be marshaled to address the question.\nInvestigating it question will inevitably involve addressing a number of subordinate issues, which can be roughly thought of as falling under one of two ‘sets.’ One set will deal with education policy, and will touch upon broad questions like ‘How clear is the relationship between tertiary school enrollment—and specifically school enrollment in scientific fields—and S&T outcomes?’ The second set, albeit one that has significant overlap with the first, will have to do with finance, i.e. expenditure on research and development. This set will address questions such as ‘How is R&D expenditure typically allocated between basic, applied and experimental research, etc.?’; and ‘Who finances and who performs R&D?’. After establishing an empirical background on these subjects, the paper will transition into more normative questions. These will include ‘How much money should a particular government spend on R&D, and how should it allocates this money in doing so?’ The aim of the paper is to both discover and disseminate lessons that can be useful to policy makers in promoting the S&T agenda.\nUnstated so far has been how the ‘level’ of S&T will be measured exactly. Such an issue is not trivial; any approach will undoubtedly have its critics. To minimize these criticisms, we use at a range of scientific and technological ‘outputs’ that might approximate a level of S&T in a given country. These include the number of scientific articles authored by a country’s citizens, the number of R&D researchers in country and the number of patents held by its nationals. Of course, these are imperfect ‘proxies’ and will be utilized only when it is judicious to do so. Furthermore, due to the scanty nature of much of the collected data (that describe both the inputs, i.e. education and finance, and the specified outputs), the analysis will tend to focus on answering a fairly limited set of questions—only those which have reliable empirical backdrop. In this sense, the availability of data will drive much of what is asked about it."

    "text": "Case study: Nokia’s story\nFinland’s economic story is one of success and diversification. Initially, its economic structure was geared towards the production of raw materials; its comparative advantages were in iron ore and timber, products which found ready consumers in the economies of Western Europe. Over time, however, the country’s developed technologically and, as a result, began to create more sophisticated products, that were higher up on the economic value chain. (That said, a significant part of Finland’s economy to this day is raw material production—which suggests that there is still a role for this type of economic activity in highly advanced economies.)\nThe story of the Finnish company Nokia reflects, in some ways, the story of Finland’s economic trajectory. (The company has also been a significant factor in driving Finland’s economic trajectory—but that story will not be addressed here.) In its early stages, the company was comprised of three smaller organizations (which had formally merged together but still exercised a degree of independence from each other). Nokia Ltd. produced paper and pulp; Finnish Rubber Works produced rubber boots and tires; and Finnish Cable Works produced electrical wires and cable. For each outfit, crucial technology had been imported from abroad.\nThe electronics division of the company—which would eventually become central to the business’s functioning—was created in 1960. The profits from this venture came slowly and, often, not at all. Nonetheless, the company’s leaders were resolute in insisting on its importance; the division enjoyed sizeable monetary investments and contact with the most current technology products on the market. However, it wasn’t until the company acquired a number of businesses in the 1970s and 80s that Nokia truly transformed itself from a producer specializing in low-tech goods to one specializing in high-tech goods. In this process, the mobile phone increasingly became the company’s focus. One reason why the company was able to adapt (and able to integrate the knowledge base of its recent acquisitions) was because it had been assiduous in making investments in its human capital.\nNokia had invested substantially in the Finnish public school education, helping change the system’s orientation to one which emphasized life-long learning. It had created bridges with academia by working with a number of schools to establish ‘Nokia University’ in the 1980s. The objective of this school was to increase the educational training of its workers: if an employee had a bachelors degree, he was encouraged to get a masters; if he had a masters degree, he was encouraged to aim for doctorate. Employees were also encouraged to go abroad, to work at Nokia’s foreign affiliates, where they could acquire a more diverse set of skills than they could in Finland. In all, these efforts paid handsome dividends, helping the company immensely. Over time, however, the nature of the skill production that they encouraged changed. As the company (and the nation it was based in) developed, the skills needed by the business were increasingly seen as ‘public goods’ and fostered in the public domain, accordingly.\nA number of useful lessons follow from Nokia’s story. The first is of the importance of a long-term time horizon in business. Had Nokia’s leadership insisted on immediate profits from its electronics division after the wing had been established, the company would never have been able to reap the sizable long-run returns it eventually did. One possible reason why the business could afford to have a long-term time horizon was because it had profitable projects in place. These could be used as a safeguard for the company to fall back on, in case the investments in electronics did not pan out, and could be used to subsidize R&D investments before the investments generated returns themselves. Viewed at the issue in this regard, business competitiveness—even if it is not it is directly related to science and technology—might be important in pursuing S&T production, more generally.\nThe second lesson is of the importance of creating ‘synergies’ between various actors in a society. Nokia’s relationship with Finnish academic institutions was pivotal in raising the level of human capital among its employees—which, in turn, was pivotal in helping transform the company into its modern incarnation. …The obvious lesson for both businesses and policy makers in developing countries is to strength the linkage between the educational system and the private sector. The details of how this is should be done will undoubtedly vary with context. Nonetheless, private-sector investments in public education; programs encouraging workers to return to school; and curricula geared towards practical, industry-based issues should be considered options. In many cases, these actions would result in a win-win result. Students would be better motivated in school, knowing that, upon graduation, they can get a job using the skills they had just learned; businesses would benefit by having more knowledgeable employees in their ranks.\nResource:\nBlomström, M. and Kokko, A.

The survey is a nationally representative survey of Nigerian households. Women aged 15-49 were eligible to be interviewed if they were either permanent residents or visitors who spent the previous night in the household. A total of 7,620; 33,385; 38,948 and 41,821 women aged 15-49 were interviewed in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 surveys. The survey collected various information from women including fertility preference, sexual activity, and reproductive history, alongside background characteristics.\nThe key background variables considered in this study were percentage of women with secondary education or above, percentage of women working in the labour force, percentage of women living in urban residence, percentage of women in different geographical zones. The TFR was calculated from births and exposure during the three years (36 months) prior to each woman’s month of interview. The nominal date of a TFR is the year of the survey, but the reference period is prior to that. The reference period for the proximate determinants is also prior to the date of interview except for contraception, which is based on current contraceptive use. In terms of synchronization, the link between fertility and contraception is problematic. For individual women, contraception affects subsequent fertility, but in the data, fertility s measured for an earlier date than contraception.\nFor the estimation of index of abortion, we used the total abortion rate (TAR) reported in a survey by Guttmacher Institute [21]. The survey estimated the TAR using data on delivery of abortion and post-abortion care services from a nationally representative sample of 772 health facilities in 2012. The TAR obtained from his study was kept constant for all years of the analysis – 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018."

    "text": "2.2 Data analysis\nThis study examines the contributions of biological and behavioural determinants to fertility change, as well as the effects of the socio-economic and geographic factors through which the determinants exert their influence. Statistical analyses for inputs in the model were performed using Stata 16.0 (StataCorp) and confirmed with published DHS reports for inputs available in the reports. The proximate determinants of fertility, potential fertility and background variables were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2019 software. In the following section we present detailed analysis of fertility differentials that quantifies the negative and positive effects of each of the socio-economic and geographic factors on fertility through various intermediate fertility variables.\n\n2.2.1 Proximate determinants: The Bongaart’s Model\nWe used a revised version of Bongaarts’ proximate determinants model to assess the relationship between projected potential fertility (PF) and behavioural and biological factors. Each of the determinants is assumed to independently inhibit fertility. In the original model, Bongarts identified the following: an index for marriage, contraception, abortion and post-partum infecundity and expressed TFR as the product of the four indices together with total fecundity (TF) - the average number of live births expected among women during their entire lifetime, [9].\n\\[\nTFR = C_m\\:*\\:C_{i}\\:*\\:C_{c}\\:*\\:C_{a}\\:*\\:TF\n\\]\nwhere, TFR is the total fertility rate, Cm is the index of proportion married, Ci is the index of post-partum infecundability, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Cc is the index of contraception. The indices only take values between 0 and 1. If the corresponding index is of no fertility inhibition effect, the index equals 1; an index of 0 which is not empirically proven, indicates total inhibition effect [9].\nA revision of this model attempted to account for overlaps between the determinants, specifically between postpartum amenorrhea and contraceptive use [10]. The revised framework used for this study includes five intermediate fertility variables; proportion sexually exposed, postpartum infecundability, contraception, induced abortion, and sterility which are key direct determinants of fertility. From the original model, the index of marriage was revised to include women who have been in a sexual union in the last month, use contraceptives, are pregnant or post-partum infecundable. This index was renamed index of sexual exposure [10]. The index of post-partum infecundability was modified to post-partum insusceptibility including both median duration of post-partum amenorrhea and post-partum abstinence. The index of abortion was revised by multiplying contraceptive prevalence with average use effectiveness of contraception [10].\nThe index of sterility was modified from proportion of women 45-49 years old who had no live births to the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund. Index of contraception was revised to the proportion of sexually active fecund women using contraceptives that do not overlap with those experiencing postpartum amenorrhea and the average effectiveness of contraception [10]. The revised equation relating the total fertility rate to the proximate determinants used in this study is expressed as:\n\\[\nTFR=PF\\:*\\:C_{x}\\:*\\:C_{u}\\:*C_{a}\\:*C_{i}\\:*C_{f}\\:\n\\]\nWhere TFR is the total fertility rate, PF is the potential fertility, Cx represents the index of sexual exposure, Cu is the index of contraception, Ca is the index of induced abortion, Ci is the index of postpartum insusceptibility and Cf represents the index of sterility. Estimates from empirical data showed an average potential fertility of 21 (18-24) births per woman for the 35-year reproductive period from age 15 to 49 years [10]. Nonetheless, estimates of PF may exceed its theoretical limits because of a large error term in the proximate determinants’ framework, attributed in a large part to the effects of unmeasured factors exogenous to the framework [22].\n\n\n2.2.2 The index of sexual exposure (Cx)\nThe index of sexual exposure expresses the reduction in fertility caused by women’s not being sexually active throughout their entire reproductive period. The index is calculated as:\n\\[\nC_x=\\:s\n\\]\nwhere s is the proportion of women aged 15-49 who are sexually active (women who either are pregnant, report sex in the last month, use contraception, or are postpartum infecundable). The index of sexual exposure, Cx, equals 1 if all women of reproductive age are sexually active during the entire reproductive period and 0 in the absence of such.\n\n\n2.2.3 The index of contraception (Cc)\nThis considers both the level of contraceptive prevalence and the average effectiveness of contraceptive methods used. It is estimated as:\n\\[\nC_c=\\:1\\:-\\:1.08ue\n\\]\nwhere u is the proportion of women in the reproductive ages who are currently using contraception among those sexually active, excluding exclude those infecund and postpartum amenorrhic within 6 months after birth; and e is the average of use-effectiveness of contraception as practiced in the population. Estimates of the method-specific effectiveness are: sterilization (0.995), pill (0.930), injectable (0.970), implant (0.999), intra-uterine device (0.993), male condom (0.870), and other modern methods (0.800) [23].\n\n\n2.2.4 The index of sexual abortion (Ca)\nThe index of abortion is the proportion by which the PF is reduced due to induced abortion. Births averted per induced abortion are related to contraceptive use [22]. The index of abortion is defined as the ratio of the observed TFR to the estimated TFR without induced abortion, and declines with increasing incidence of induced abortion [10]. This index is calculated as follows:\n\\[\nC_a=\\frac{TFR}{TFR\\:+\\:0.4\\:*\\:(1\\:+\\:u)\\:*\\:TAR}\n\\]\nwhere TFR is the total fertility rate, u represents the proportion protected by contraception among women who have an induced abortion and TAR is the total abortion rate which is the average number of induced abortions per married or in-union woman at the end of the reproductive period if induced abortions remain at prevailing levels. The index of induced abortion equals 1 in the absence of induced abortion and 0 if all pregnancies are aborted. Reliable data on the total abortion rate for all years is not available. We assumed abortion rates prevailing in 2012 [21], will remain constant throughout 2018.\n\n\n2.2.5 The index of postpartum infecundability (Ci)\nThe index of postpartum infecundability represents the reduced risk of exposure to conception immediately following a birth [24]. In the absence of any breastfeeding (and postpartum abstinence), the average birth interval is around 20 months, which includes four segments: a period of postpartum amenorrhea (1.5 months), the average waiting time to conception (7.5 months), time added by spontaneous intrauterine mortality (2 months) and 9 months of a full term pregnancy. The last three segments are assumed constant and sum up to 18.5 months. Postpartum amenorrhea is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. The index of postpartum infecundability is estimated by the ratio of the average birth interval where breastfeeding and abstinence are absent, and the length of a birth interval where the period of postpartum infecundability is extended by breastfeeding and abstinence. It is estimated using the formula:\n\\[\nC_i\\:=\\:\\frac{20}{18.5\\:+\\:i}\n\\]\nwhere Ci = index of postpartum infecundability; and i = average duration of postpartum infecundability due to breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence. In the absence of breastfeeding and abstinence, i would be equal to 1.5, its minimum possible value, and Ci would equal 1. As the duration of postpartum infecundability increases, Ci declines and it would tend towards 0 if the duration of postpartum infecundability were to continue indefinitely.\n\n\n2.2.6 The index of sterility (Cs)\nCs measures the incidence of natural infertility and pathological sterility. This index expresses the total effect of infecundity because of a pathological condition. The net effect of pathological sterility would be the difference between the actual index and some base value that represents natural infecundity. The formula for measuring the index of sterility is represented as:\n\\[\nC_f~=\\:1\\:-\\:f\n\\]\nwhere f is defined as the proportion of sexually active women who are infecund."

    "text": "2.3 Background and institutional factors\nIn this study, we assessed the socio-economic or contextual characteristics that influence fertility through changes in the proximate determinants. These were the level of education, female participation in the workforce, wealth quintile, geopolitical regions and type of residence. Each of these factors has well established associations with fertility [25]. We examined fertility preferences through the ideal number of children and desire for more children. The DHS asks women with living children, “If you could go back to the time [when] you did not have any children and could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” For women who are yet to give birth, the question is framed as “If you could choose exactly the number of children to have in your whole life, how many would that be?” (National Population Commission and ICF International 2019). We considered only numeric responses. The survey also asked women whether they wanted more children in addition to those they have, thus reflecting desire for further reproduction.\nThe study also tracked four indicators of women’s fertility preferences. The key indicators that reflect fertility-related international policy and program priorities include planning status for most recent birth in the past five years, percent of children born to mothers under age 18, percent of children born to mothers over age 34, and the median length of the birth interval (in months). We assessed the strength of Nigeria’s Family planning programs using the Family Planning Effort Index (FPEI) and National Composite Index on Family Planning (NCIFP). The FPE has been collected periodically since 1972, and provides results across four key components: policies, services, evaluation, and access [26]. The index was developed to measure the level of effort that goes into FP programs, and to track how these changes over time. The NCIPF measures the existence and implementation of family planning policies and program under five components: strategy, data, quality, equity, and accountability. It is built on the FPEIS framework [27]."

    "text": "2.4 Results\nThe indices of direct biological and behavioural determinants of fertility from Bongaarts models is shown in Table 1. The behavioural indices include index of sexual exposure (Cx), index of contraception (Cc)and index of abortion (Ca) while the index of sterility (Cs) is a biological determinant. Postpartum infecundability (Ci) is a function of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and postpartum abstinence. The duration of amenorrhea is a function of the normal length of amenorrhea after childbirth women which is due to breastfeeding practices. The duration of abstinence is entirely behavioural.\n\n\n\nEstimated Indices for Proximate Determinants of Fertility, DHS\n2003-2018YearCxCiCaCfCuPFSurvey TFRModel TFR20030.700.590.940.810.8521.005.655.6520080.700.620.940.820.8220.725.725.8020130.720.640.940.800.8119.485.505.9320180.680.640.940.800.8219.615.295.67Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2003-2018\n\n\nCi was the lowest among the indices in our study at 0.64 in the 2018 survey. This implies that postpartum infecundability is associated with reduction of potential fertility by 36% from its biological maximum. Delayed sexual exposure (Cx) inhibited fertility by 32% being the second most effective ferility reducing factor. The index of abortion was high at 0.94. Hence, abortion [28–30]. This index is therefore excluded from the discussions. The other reductions in PF occurred because of inability to bear children (Cf, 0.80) and effects from the use of contraceptive technologies (Cu, 0.82). The lowest contributor is the index of contraception, contributing to 18% reduction in PF. There were little changes during the period of the survey in the 5 indices.\nThe revised Bongaart’s model gave an estimated TFR of 5.67, which is 0.38 children higher than TFR measured by DHS survey in 2018 (5.29). The analysis arrived at similar values for 2003 (5.65 each). Any difference between these sets of TFRs may be due to underestimation in DHS samples, inaccuracies in the data, inexactitude in our estimation of the indices, or other factors left out of the model. Nevertheless, the model shows the relative contributions of the determinants, and enables us report variations between socio-economic and geographic groups, as well as changes over the years of the surveys 2003-2018.\nThe influence of the proximate determinants and their variability by these background factors are presented in tables 2, 3, 4 and 5 for 2018, 2013, 2008 and 2003 respectively. The study shows that for 2018, attainment of secondary education is associated with relatively low indices for sexual exposure (0.58) and contraception (0.62). Across the educational attainment levels, these two indices have an inverse relationship in all years of the survey. On the other hand, the index of postpartum infecundability increases with additional educational attainment. This would reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Concerning disparity in place of residence and wealth, Cx was higher among rural residents in all years (rural - 0.74, urban - 061). This means sexual exposure inhibited fertility by 33.5% among rural residents, and 39% among city dwellers. On the contrary, the Ci was higher among urban residents (rural - 0.61, urban - 0.68). Contribution of sterility to reducing PF is not dependent on place of residence, as Cf in all years were within ±0.03 units. As expected, the index of contraception is higher in rural areas relative to urban population, reflecting a higher contraceptive use among sexually exposed female urban dwellers. There also are notable differences between women of different wealth quintiles. The values of the indices are lower for women in higher wealth quintiles, meaning a higher depression of fertility, with exception of Ci. The Ci increases progressively along the wealth quintiles (lowest - 0.56, second - 0.61, middle - 0.64, fourth - 0.68, highest - 0.75) in 2018, as well as across all the years of the survey.\nWorkforce participation is associated with a lower fertility in 2018, with no notable difference in preceding years. In the latest year of the survey, the estimated TFR among women in workforce was 5.22, compared to 5.93 in women without workforce participation. In 2013 however, the reverse was the case (in workforce - 5.76, not in workforce - 5.62) The differences were negligible in 2008 (in workforce – 5.93, not in workforce - 5.99), and 2003 (in workforce - 5.78, not in workforce - 5.74). In all years, the index of contraception contributed more to depression of fertility among those in workforce compared to those not active in workforce. In contrast, the index of marriage and index of sterility contributed more to fertility reduction among women of reproductive age not active in workforce. The contributions of the index of postpartum infecundability and index of abortion were near identical.\n\n\n\nEstimated indices of proximate determinants of fertility 2018VariablesCxCiCaCfCuPFTFR (Survey)TFR (Bongaarts)National0.680.640.940.800.8219.615.295.67EducationNo education0.830.580.950.780.9120.576.746.88Primary0.690.630.940.750.6927.655.814.41Secondary/Higher0.580.700.910.840.6222.094.214.00ResidenceUrban0.610.680.920.800.5924.824.503.81Rural0.740.610.940.800.8121.455.945.82Wealth quintileLowest0.790.560.950.810.9121.446.706.56Second0.750.610.950.800.8421.266.206.12Middle0.660.640.940.790.7523.895.594.91Fourth0.630.680.920.800.6123.634.554.04Highest0.610.730.900.800.5421.823.793.65WorkforceIn workforce0.730.640.930.780.6722.945.224.78Not in workforce0.580.630.940.860.8423.685.935.26RegionsNorth Central0.650.630.930.800.7023.735.034.45North East0.730.620.950.820.8420.606.066.18North West0.770.580.950.830.8621.816.606.35South East0.550.690.920.770.5631.444.723.15South South0.630.750.900.740.6320.054.034.22South West0.630.680.910.800.5323.243.863.49Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated indices of proximate determinants of fertility 2013VariablesCxCiCaCfCuPFTFR (Survey)TFR (Bongaarts)AggregateNational0.720.640.940.800.8119.485.505.93EducationNo education0.860.580.950.770.9420.206.937.20Primary0.740.630.950.780.6527.276.134.72Secondary/Higher0.590.720.910.860.5024.794.213.57ResidenceUrban0.650.700.920.820.5126.494.663.69Rural0.780.610.950.800.7922.066.185.88Wealth quintileLowest0.860.570.960.770.9619.846.957.36Second0.780.580.950.800.8722.136.726.38Middle0.670.640.940.800.7125.145.684.74Fourth0.660.700.930.810.5625.524.894.02Highest0.660.760.900.830.4224.463.903.35WorkforceIn workforce0.790.640.940.780.6324.555.764.93Not in workforce0.610.640.940.860.7723.435.625.04RegionsNorth Central0.650.630.940.820.6824.635.284.50North East0.790.620.950.790.9318.476.307.16North West0.830.580.950.790.8720.756.686.76South East0.570.690.920.770.4537.894.712.61South South0.660.760.910.810.4923.604.273.80South West0.670.690.920.840.3734.194.552.79Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated indices of proximate determinants of fertility 2008VariablesCxCiCaCfCuPFTFR (Survey)TFR (Bongaarts)National0.700.620.940.820.8220.725.725.80EducationNo education0.850.570.960.770.9421.807.297.02Primary0.710.630.950.820.7225.956.495.25Secondary/Higher0.550.690.910.890.5424.854.233.57ResidenceUrban0.650.700.920.840.5623.714.714.17Rural0.730.590.950.810.7923.836.285.53Wealth quintileLowest0.830.560.960.800.9421.297.127.02Second0.760.570.960.810.8724.177.026.10Middle0.660.600.950.810.7724.925.884.95Fourth0.640.690.930.840.6023.924.964.35Highest0.640.750.900.860.4722.794.043.72WorkforceIn workforce0.770.620.940.800.6724.545.935.08Not in workforce0.600.610.950.870.7726.245.994.79RegionsNorth Central0.660.560.940.800.7326.425.414.30North East0.810.590.960.800.9320.977.167.17North West0.860.580.960.810.9520.197.307.59South East0.510.730.920.800.5731.084.823.26South South0.660.710.920.840.5125.494.693.86South West0.640.650.920.840.4928.484.523.33Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2008\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated indices of proximate determinants of fertility 2003VariablesCxCiCaCfCuPFTFR (Survey)TFR (Bongaarts)AggregateNational0.700.590.940.810.8521.005.655.65EducationNo education0.830.560.950.730.9321.786.716.47Primary0.690.610.950.830.7625.196.325.27Secondary/Higher0.560.750.910.910.6020.124.244.43ResidenceUrban0.660.640.930.820.6523.124.864.41Rural0.730.570.950.800.8223.586.075.41Wealth quintileLowest0.770.540.950.770.8624.626.525.56Second0.770.560.950.780.8722.766.305.81Middle0.690.570.950.790.8423.285.705.14Fourth0.660.640.940.820.7424.195.855.08Highest0.640.770.910.880.5818.464.214.79WorkforceIn workforce0.770.590.950.790.7323.235.785.23Not in workforce0.610.600.940.830.8025.045.744.81RegionsNorth Central0.600.530.950.810.7132.485.703.69North East0.770.570.960.790.9123.147.036.38North West0.870.590.950.780.9318.666.697.53South East0.560.630.920.780.7123.164.113.73South South0.630.720.920.840.5823.134.634.20South West0.560.650.921.000.4925.204.123.43Data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey 2003\n\n\nThis study also attempts to examine the effects of inputs into Nigeria’s family planning program on fertility reduction. The family planning effort index (FEPI) is based on the aggregate of four dimensions of family planning effort (policies, services, evaluation, and method access). Raw scores were converted to percentages and are reported. FEPI increased between 1972 and 1999, then reduced through 2009, before increasing to 41% in 2014. The increase in FEPI to its all-time highest in 1999 corresponds to the lowest survey TFR recorded in Nigeria, 5.11 in 1999 [31]. During this time, access to contraceptives was high at 70.3%, and evaluation of services rendered stood at 81.4% (see Supplementary Information). The FEPI has since been replaced by another measure, the National Composite Index on Family Planning, NCIFP (see Supplementary Information). The most recent NCIFP in 2017 assessed the strategy (score - 62.4%), data (65.5%), quality (62.0%), accountability (39.0%) and equity (58.0%) of family planning in Nigeria. On all measures, the scores in 2017 (composite index - 62.4%) were higher than those in 2014 (composite index - 49.5%).\n{fig-fp-effort-index}\nLastly, the study includes some outcome indicators. The state of planning for new births and incidence of births among the young and aged population are a reflection of policy priorities concerning reproductive options available to women. [25]. Among 12.2% of women aged 15-49 years with at least one child, the most recent birth was planned i.e. they wanted to have their last child at the time. There has been no notable increase in the median birth interval. The percentage of births to women less than 18 years of age has steadily reduced from 8.9% in 2003 to 6.0% in 2018. Overall, after an initial increase between 2003 and 2008, the percentage of births to women older than 34 years has remained relatively unchanged.\n\n\n\nSome Women Reproductive Options Outcome IndicatorsOutcome Indicator2003200820132018Proportion that planned most recent birth (%)16.711.99.812.2Median birth intervals (in months)31.231.331.730.9Proportion of births to women &lt;18 years (%)8.97.37.16.0Proportion of births to women &gt;34 years (%)14.415.315.315.0"

    "title": "\nBiological and Behavioural Determinants of Fertility in Nigeria",
    "section": "2.5 Discussion",
    "text": "2.5 Discussion\nThis study used the revised Bongaart’s model to show contributions of the biological and behavioural determinants of fertility in Nigeria, and the effects of selected socio-economic and geographical variables. We found that postpartum infecundability consistently had the strongest inhibitory effect on fertility rates from 2003 to 2018, closely followed by delayed sexual exposure and sterility. In contrast, abortion had the least inhibitory effect, proceeded by contraception use. Regarding socio-economic and geographical correlates, our study shows that the inhibitory effect of contraception, abortion, delayed sexual exposure were more evident among highly educated and rich women residing in urban areas of Southern Nigeria. Additionally, the recent index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate an increase in family planning program efforts from 2014 to 2017. We also found that fertility levels were highest in the Northwest and lowest in Southwest, and this pattern was consistent from 2003 to 2018.\nOne of the most significant findings in our study was that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. A plausible explanation for the dominant inhibiting effect of postpartum infecundability could be the effect of prolonged breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea. There is a clear association between the duration and intensity of breastfeeding, the length of postpartum amenorrhea, and postpartum infecundability. For instance, [24] demonstrated that the risk of conception increases in the absence of breastfeeding after postpartum menstruation resumes. Similar studies conducted in Nigeria [32] and other sub-Saharan African countries including Zambia [13], Malawi [33] and Ethopia [8], have also indicated that postpartum infecundability had the greatest inhibiting effect on fertility rates. Recognizing the impact of postpartum infecundability on fertility rates has key policy implications for addressing Nigeria’s high fertility rates. Analysis of the effect of education and wealth on postpartum infecundability highlighted a positive correlation between postpartum infecundability and additional educational attainment. This is similar to findings by [34], and reflect shorter duration of breastfeeding which is essential to prolong duration of postpartum amenorrhea, and quicker cessation of sexual abstinence after delivery. Asides postpartum infecundability, delayed sexual exposure and sterility were the major contributors to the reduced fertility levels in Nigeria. The contribution of delayed sexual exposure to reduced TFRs in the Southern regions reflects a higher awareness and uptake of contraception, as well as the postponement of the age of first marriage in the Southern region (usually due to education) compared to the Northern region [35].\nAbortion and contraception had the least inhibitory effects on fertility. Unlike previous studies on the proximate determinants of fertility in sub-Saharan Africa [13,36], we were able to estimate the index of abortion in this study. The reduced inhibitory effect of abortion may be attributed to its illegal status in Nigeria. Abortion is only allowed when it is necessary to save a woman’s life. [21]. Sociocultural and religious norms surrounding induced abortion in Nigeria could also contribute to its diminished impact on fertility rates [21]. Increased contraceptive intake is typically associated with reduced fertility rates [37]. As a result, we initially hypothesized that the intensified national family planning efforts would result in a higher inhibitory effect of contraception on fertility rates. However, our study showed that the use of contraception only accounted for only 18% in fertility reduction in 2018. Similar to our finding, a previous study conducted in Uganda [38] also found that contraception had the least inhibitory effect on fertility. Both findings contrasts the study by Mahjabeen and Khan [34] who found that contraception had the highest impact on reducing fertility, accounting for 51% of the decrease in TFR in Zambia. Potential reasons for the high inhibitory effect of contraception in Zambia include cultural acceptance and availability of contraception, education and awareness about family planning, and government policies and programs promoting contraception use.\nThe relationship between socio-economic and geographical correlates can be clearly seen in this study. We found that the 5 proximate determinants considered in this study varied with education, wealth, workforce participation and residence. Sexual exposure had a higher inhibitory effect on rural residents than urban residents, probably due to factors such as limited access to family planning services, lower socioeconomic development, cultural and religious beliefs, and reduced health information and awareness. These disparities highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve access to contraception, address socioeconomic challenges, provide health education, and consider cultural and religious contexts in rural communities. Contraception use had a higher inhibitory effect on fertility in urban residents compared to rural residents. One reason could be that urban women are more likely to use contraceptives than are rural women. Another reason could be that women who are highly educated, and lived in urban regions tend to delay marriage and are more likely to use modern methods of contraception [39]. Postpartum infecundability had lesser inhibitory effects on highly educated, rich urban women. This may be correlated with shorter durations of breastfeeding probably due to the intense work schedules common in urban areas.\nThe index for FEPI and NCIFP indicate Nigeria’s significant strides in improving access to family planning services, and reducing the unmet need for contraception (i.e., a larger proportion of individuals who desire to use contraception have access to it). However, it also suggests that providing accessible reproductive options is not currently a primary policy focus in Nigeria. There is need for continued investment and implementation of effective family planning programs to improve program scores, sustain positive implications and achieve the sustainable development goals.\nA major limitation of this study is the reliance on secondary data collected using a cross sectional design study design. Additionally, since the information collected in this study was self-reported, there is risk of responder bias due to cultural beliefs and attitude towards fertility issues. For instance, women tend to omit some of the children they have given birth to, particularly those living in other households and those who have died [40]. Nonetheless, a key strength in our study is that we were able to expand our model to include key contextual factors that affect fertility such as socio-economic status and geographical location that can also significantly influence fertility."

Therefore, we suggest policies that prioritize postpartum health support, raise awareness about postpartum infecundability and its implications for fertility rates, and promote breastfeeding initiatives and family planning programs. These policies should be designed to extend the duration of infecundability, thereby contributing to the reduction of TFRs in Nigeria. We recommend communication and messaging around family planning all require financial resources. It is critical that enough funds are provided to support these efforts.These approaches ought to be specific to the different geopolitical zones since There are varying behavioural and proximate determinants unique to these regions.

    "title": "Labour Absorption and Employment Elasticities in Nigeria",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe ultimate goal of every nation is the well-being of its citizens regardless of its economic, political and social settings. This is reflected by economic development which dwells on growth and distributions as well as their interconnections. A distinctive strength of the informal sector especially its Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) is the effective and efficient absorption of labour and growth in employment.\nLabour is an important factor that enables economic development through the production of goods and services and the satisfaction of individuals’ needs. Economic performance is a function of capital and labour. Economic indicators relating to employment, particularly those that evaluate a country’s ability to provide enough jobs for its people, can give you a lot of information about a country’s overall macroeconomic performance. Unemployment rates, employment-to-population ratios, and labour force participation rates are among the most generally discussed metrics along these lines. The employment intensity of growth or elasticity of employment with regard to output is another labour market indicator that indicates employment growth related to economic growth.\nFor a country like Nigeria, where unemployment rates keep rising and the population also increasing. It is important to understand the past and current employment and absorption capacity of the country as it can provide vital information that can be used for policymaking to curb unemployment.\nHence, it is of the essence that labour absorption and employment elasticities be studied. This analysis uses descriptive methods to analyze labour absorption and employment elasticities in Nigeria.\n\n\nLabour Absorption\nLabour absorption is the level at which the working population are engaged in economic activities at a particular period of time and the metric for labour absorption is “Labour Absorption Rate (LAR)” or “Employment to Population Ratio.”\nAccording to the ILO database, the employment-to-population ratio expresses the number of persons who are employed as a percentage of the total working-age population. In other words, it is the proportion of the working-age population aged 15-65 years that is employed. It measures the proportion of the working-age population that is employed (Ozili 2020)\nMathematically,\n\\[\n\\textrm{Employment To Population Ratio}=\\frac{\\textrm{total Employed}}{\\textrm{Working Age Population}} \\times 100\n\\]\nThe labour absorption rate (LAR) in Nigeria has been on a continual decrease since 2014 with a significant decrease in 2020 as shown in figure 1 below. This shows that the working-age population is growing more compared to the levels of employment (working-age population addition yearly is over a million while for employment is in thousands). The significant decrease in 2020 can be attributed to the pandemic when a lot of jobs were lost and the working-age population kept increasing (Ozili 2020; PwC 2020).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Labour absorption rate in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\nDisaggregating LAR into full and part-time employment brings a better understanding of LAR as shown in figure 2 below. The fall in LAR for full-time employment followed the same pattern as the general LAR which is normal but interestingly part-time employment was on the increase with the exception of 2020, the pandemic year.\nThis is because, following the law governing demand and supply of labour, all things being equal “increase supply of labour leads to decrease in wages”. A decrease in wages implies a decrease in working hours hence increased part-time employment. Due to the increasing nature of the working population and employment increasing at a decreasing rate, the number of hours decreases as a reaction to decreasing in wages.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Labour absorption by employment type\n\n\nFurther, in the analysis, LAR was disaggregated by zone. The descriptive showed nothing out of the normal as shown in figure 3 below. LAR are highest in the two economic zones in Nigeria where the economic hub and the Federal capital territory are located. South-South and North West follow closely with South-South being the domain of oil which is the primary source of revenue for the country and Northwest housing Kano, the business capital in the north. The Northwest has the lowest LAR and this is due to insecurity coupled with the pandemic of 2020 which has shut down most economic activities even agriculture has been disrupted. People are gradually bringing back economic activities and leaving Internal Displaced Persons Camps (IDP camps) to being farming\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Labour absorption by geo-political zones in Nigeria. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Elasticity\nEmployment elasticity (EE) also called “Employment Intensity of Growth” is a measure of the percentage change in employment associated with a percentage point change in growth for a sector or total GDP. The employment elasticity indicates the ability of an economy to generate employment opportunities for its population as a percentage of its growth.\nEmployment is an important element of growth and development; it acts as a link between economic growth and poverty reduction. Employment elasticities are also frequently used to track industry potential for job creation and estimate future employment development.\nMathematically, EE is calculated in two ways;\n1.      The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) method: This method gives the “arc” employment elasticity, this is the elasticity of one variable in relation to another between two given points. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\ne = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nWhere L refers to employment, Y GDP and \\(\\Delta\\) percentage change. Change in GDP is essentially GDP growth rate.\n2.      The Regression approach: This on the other hand provides the “point” elasticity, this is the elasticity at a specific point on the curve. It is calculated using the formula below\n\\[\nln L = \\alpha + \\beta lnY\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\beta\\) serves as the employment elasticity. When the derivative is taken, we arrive at;\n\\[\ne = \\frac{dlnL}{dlnY} = \\frac{\\Delta L/L}{\\Delta Y/Y}\n\\]\nIn a nutshell, EE examines how economic growth (output) and employment evolve together over time. Looking at the EE of Nigeria from 2011 to 2022, EE growth has not been stable as shown below in figure 4. Employment elasticity in 2012, 2016 and 2017 was negative. In 2016 there was a recession and in 2017, Nigeria was still trying to get back on its feet. During a recession, economic growth becomes negative and industries will have to lay off workers or cut wages in other to survive. By 2018, the economy was booming. This shows that a 1 per cent increase in growth led to a 0.5 per cent increase in employment.\nIn 2021 after the pandemic, the economy was recovering from the pandemic shocks and different job opportunities were springing forth which include Artificial intelligence and data analytics which were majorly remote and the barrier for location was eliminated (Jenq, Lain, and Vishwanath 2021; WEF 2020). This explains why the employment elasticity was 7.4 per cent meaning for every 1 per cent increase in growth, employment increased by 7.4 per cent.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Employment elasticity in Nigeria between 2010 and 2022. Source: Author’s computation based on data from NBS\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is evident from the above data that Nigeria is not doing well when it comes to employment generation and absorbing its working population. A high working-age population implies availability of labour which is an advantage when utilize will boost economic growth substantially.  The continuous decrease in LAR means two things either the job creation level is not growing or the working-age population grows more than the level of employment creation, the latter seems to be most suitable. Another reason for the fall in LAR is the lack of skilled labour to be employed and the information asymmetry that exists in the labour market. Hence there is a need to encourage and build more vocational centers and improve the standard of education. To build an economy that has the capacity to absorb its labour, the quality and skills of workers need to be addressed because increased investment married with a skilled labour force will lead to economic growth and subsequently the creation of employment.\nAlso, EE figures indicate the existence of “jobless growth” which is a result of the slow pace of job creation in Nigeria. Jobless growth is a term used when there is continuous macroeconomic economic growth without a corresponding growth in job creation (PwC 2018). Major cause of jobless growth in Nigeria includes lack of diversification, poor economic restructuring, poor macroeconomic policies, e.t.c.\nIt is of the essence that government look into existing employment polices to ensure greater participation of youths. Government should focus on capital expenditure in order to increase the employment intensity of the private sector especially for MSMEs.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nJenq, Christina, Jonathan Lain, and Tara Vishwanath. 2021. “Good Jobs for a New Generation: Delivering Quality Jobs for Young Nigerians After COVID-19.” https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/511161631652256763/pdf/Good-Jobs-for-a-New-Generation-Delivering-Quality-Jobs-for-Young-Nigerians-After-COVID-19.pdf.\n\n\nOzili, Peterson K. 2020. “COVID-19 Pandemic and Economic Crisis: The Nigerian Experience and Structural Causes.” Journal of Economic and Administrative Sciences 37 (4): 401–18. https://doi.org/10.1108/jeas-05-2020-0074.\n\n\nPwC. 2018. “Structural Transformation and Jobless Growth in Nigeria.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/structural-transformation-jobless-growth-Nigeria.pdf.\n\n\n———. 2020. “Impact of COVID-19 on the Supply Chain Industry.” https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/assets/pdf/impact-of-covid19-the-supply-chain-industry.pdf.\n\n\nWEF. 2020. “The Future of Jobs Report 2020.” https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf."

    "section": "6.1 Marriage Payments",
    "text": "6.1 Marriage Payments\nIn societies where property rights are secure and therefore women can inherit property, at marriage, the woman’s family endows the new household with a payment referred to as dowry, over which the woman retain control during marriage. I define this dowry in terms of land. This means that individuals in the new family exercise controls rights over portions of land that they own out of the total amount of land owned collectively by the household, and can transact in them. Thus, the partners can bargain in the household and therefore marriage responds to market trends. If the land market becomes more important, that is, rental rates increase, there is no necessary inducement to polygyny since both parties earn from the gains in property income. However, marriage rates will generally be higher (Becker, 1973). If women do not receive dowries upon marriage in such societies, they would lose their right to property when they enter marriage, and therefore women will not marry; an equilibrium that is unsustainable. In societies where property rights are not secure, and therefore women cannot inherit property, at marriage, the husband’s family pays a bride-price to the woman’s family. However, such marriage endows the household with a piece of land, but neither the man or woman have property right over the land. Otherwise, the woman’s property rights status changes through marriage, and that will be unsustainable in a non-polyandrous equilibrium. In essence, the state of property rights determines whether marriage involves bridewealth or dowry payments, with payments going in different directions to ensure that women property right status do not change upon marriage. Divorce under property rights also insures that the woman retains her property (dowry) after the divorce, whereas in the absence of property rights, women do not retain rights over any property since they did not have such right while in marriage.\nAccording to Becker (1993)  and Zhang and Chan (1999), if the rule for the division of output within the marriage is inflexible, so that the share of income of each spouse is not the same as that under the market solution, then an upfront compensatory transfer will be made between the kin of spouses. Using age differences as a measure of the relative share of income in the new household, the payment of positive bride price also means that there will be age gaps between the man and the woman. In similar terms the payment of dowry will also respond to the differences in the ages of the partners and will respond to the intended share of household output between the partners. There is evidence that the older a woman is, the less is the bride price and this evidence supports higher bride price when women ages are lower.\nIn this paper, bride price represents the difference between the value of household endowment of land resulting from marriage and the share of income that wives receive in the household in equilibrium under common rights. Bride-price can also be interpreted as the only means the bride family can generate income outside of land since they cannot make transactions on land due to absence of secure rights. Thus ability to generate off-farm income in the absence of property rights should reduce bride price payments, and represents a channel through which wage opportunities or the labor market may influence marriage payments. As off-farm opportunities increase due to increased off-farm wage opportunities, the age gap closes, bride price reduces, dowry payment increases (Rao 1993), and the distribution of income in the emerging households become more even. Thus women become less expensive in terms of bride price but more expensive in dowry payments. The reduction in age-gaps also leads to reduction in the rates of polygyny since income sharing between couples is more even and men are less able to extract surplus from women. However if the value of land also appreciates, the reduction in age gap is minimal, since the incentive to marry additional wife in order to acquire more land even grows stronger and therefore minimizes the impact of wage opportunities on marriage (see Becker 1973). There is some evidence that growth in non-farm wage opportunities through schooling increases the value of land by way of those employments taking up some of the society’s land and more people demanding for land."

    "section": "6.2 Age at Marriage",
    "text": "6.2 Age at Marriage\nGenerally, men marry at relatively younger ages under customary rights than under individual land rights. There are two sources of this phenomenon. First, under insecure property rights, in addition to allocating part of the land they cultivate, parents negotiate land acquisition for their sons from the lineage. Due to uncertainties of inheritance, particularly since land undergoes redistribution, a young man will want to marry, establish the household and aquire land through the father before his death. Second, there are incentives to begin wealth accumulation early since early start implies a wealthier old age.\nUnder customary rights, a man’s welfare depends on his number of wives through two channels. One is the amount of surplus he receives from each wife while each wife takes care of her children from whatever share of income she receives. The other is the transfer payment he receives from grown up sons when he is old. In old age, he must live on transfers from his children since he has no opportunity of earning income from other sources. Therefore the larger his family is, the better for his welfare, and the earlier he begins to have children, the better.\nUnder secure rights, a young individual can only inherit land from his father. Father’s welfare does not depend only on children, since he can always sell or rent the land for some income and live on rent income for the rest of his life after leaving the farm. Unmarried sons do not have the status to acquire land."

The forces of demand also implies that age at marriage is driven downward for women where the supply of older women is unable to meet the demand. Although it may exist for men, there is no rule that makes the elder woman to marry before the younger.\nIf we allow for heterogeneity among women in terms of women abilities, we expect that a man marrying multiple wives under defined rights must care more about both the productive quality of the woman, while under insecure rights, they will only care about her reproductive quality. The reasons are that the woman immediately brings along with her a plot of land for the household. While the motive for marriage under communal tenure is basically children and the land that the woman brings, the motive under private tenure is the woman’s productivity."

    "section": "2.1 Land Abundance and Wages",
    "text": "2.1 Land Abundance and Wages\nUnder private ownership structure, land is acquired mainly through inheritance, purchase, and clearing of virgin forest (deforestation), which is accompanied by some payments in kind or in some small amount of money to the community. Land abundance results in low price of land, and landless households who supply labor are able to aquire farmland easily. Farmland rentals are uncommon while sharecropping is non-existent since there are no significant shocks to agriculture. The low prize of land thus strengthens the labor demand ‘’pull’’ effects and further ‘’thins out’’ the off-farm wage sector. Non-indigenes who arrive in the community initially enter the farm wage sector. After a short period they accumulate enough income through the high wages, acquire farmland and set up a farming household. This exit from the wage sector simultaneously raises the demand for farm wage labor and reduces its supply creating excess demand in the farm wage sector which would be offset in equilibrium by labor from the off-farm wage sector. This sequence of labor drift keeps the equilibrium wage high in both farm wage and off-farm wage sectors and suppliers of non-farm wage jobs either move away from the community in search of cheaper labor from neighboring communities or employ labor from neighboring communities. In fact, opportunities for off-farm wage employment are almost non-existent. The few off-farm employers generally hire labor from outside the community.\nUnder communal ownership of land, there are no transactions in land, and landless households who are mainly immigrants cannot easily acquire land. Although land is similarly priced at very low level as in the private community, community land is divided into tracts identified with specified lineages which are exclusive in their landholding. Since there is no market for land, land abundance and the attendant low price are not internalizable and therefore do not affect the price and distribution of labor in the various segments of the economy. Profit maximizing firms respond to the incentives of low wages and locate non-farm employment opportunities in the community and hire workers from there."

    "section": "2.2 Wage Sector and Migration",
    "text": "2.2 Wage Sector and Migration\nUnder private ownership, an individual making a decision to leave the farm may either leave his land to fallow, rent it to the landless to cultivate for some annual rent or sell it outrightly. Except in cases where some viable investments exist on the land or where the land is suitably located (for example located in the vicinity of the dwelling areas as opposed to inside the forest), income from rents or sale are quite negligible. The combined forces of land abundance and the minimal level of risk associated with agriculture obviates the demand for land sharecropping contracts. Where individuals make profits through mere arbitrage on land transactions, such income fizzles in short time since there are no barriers to entering the land market. An individual who leaves the farm is faced with the options of entering the non-farm wage sector (where opportunities really do not exist) or leaving the community to become part of migrant labor. Since land sale is not an attractive option due to the low price, the only other alternative to land fallowing is to cultivate using hired labor. However, since wages are high in the farm-wage sector, there are no gains from substituting own costless labor with an expensive alternative2. Such labor substitution constitutes utility loss to the household since the substitution merely raises input costs at given level of output. This utility loss will therefore tend to keep household labor on the farm. Wages are high in the ‘’thin’’ farm-wage sector while there are no opportunities in the non-farm wage sector.\nUnder communal landholding, the monetary price of land does not enter the calculus, and due to the cooperative nature of farming in the community, there are near costless alternatives to labor on the farm such that there are almost no utility loss on the farm in the event of moving a unit of labor away from the farmland. Opportunities in the farm wage sector are diminished by cooperative labor while the non-farm wage sector is enlarged by household labor moving away from the farmland. It is fairly imaginable that households under communal tenure are often unable to accumulate agricultural surplus, thus making non-farm employment an important source of income and wealth. Households will therefore allocate labor between farm and off-farm employment up to the point where wages in the off-farm sector equates the marginal cost of releasing additional labor from the farm3. In summary, wages are low in the large off-farm sector while the farm wage sector is undermined and driven out by use of farm cooperative labor.\nAbility distribution in the communities follow naturally from the nature of the factors engineering the movement into and out of the farm and wage sectors. In the communal economy where households are unable to accumulate agricultural surplus, more able individuals will leave the farmland and enter the non-farm wage sector while those with low ability will remain on the farm. Decline in off-farm wage due to labor growth will further induce the high ability individuals to migrate into the city. Thus the city network will be made up of individuals with high ability, and individuals who subsequently migrate to the city would be entering a good network. On the other hand, in the private ownership economy, while land fertility complements labor on the farm, its abundance makes acquisition quite easy. Individuals who leave the farm will not enter the farm wage sector since this merely results in utility loss to the household. High ability individuals who may be able to earn high wages in the farm wage sector are lured back to the farm by the incentive of earning the total product of labor instead of its marginal product. Individuals with higher ability deforest virgin land and retain ownership over the tract so deforested. The farmland possibilities in essence holds back high ability individuals and individuals who leave the farm are the low ability individuals. As they are unable to compete in the farm wage sector, these migrate away from the community into the low paying unskilled jobs in the city and end up in bad job and skill networks.\nThere is ample evidence in the private societies that generally people who stay off the farm are just lazy. This confirms that they are people of low abilities. When they leave the farm, they engage mainly in lobbying jobs and follow politicians or engage in low-paying jobs around the state."

    "section": "2.3 Farming, Polygyny and Fertility",
    "text": "2.3 Farming, Polygyny and Fertility\nAn important issue in agrarian societies is the link between farmland and fertility. Communal labor sharing arrangements take place among households in the clan which is the level at which consumption sharing takes place. Under the cooperative labor arrangement, households make requests on other households in the same clan for cooperative labor. Since fertility decisions are taken at the household level rather than at clan level, household fertility should not necessarily be linked with size of farmland due to the externality that an additional child generates for all households in the clan. A study of fertility in the community showed that the amount of land owned by clans are not correlated with mean fertility in the clan. Indeed, while numerous children are seen as a means of acquiring more land, there is no consciousness in the community of having numerous children in order to have many hands on the farm (Obono, 2001). Therefore while polygyny and fertility are not induced by farm labor demand, they are positively related to the size of farmland. Migrant labor in this community are more likely to be from the off-farm pool, who move into job markets outside the community to take advantage of differential wage opportunities. Since these individuals are not simultaneously engaged on the farm, we expect that migration will be more permanent with occasional visits to the community.\nIn the private village economy, polygyny and fertility are linked with farmland not as a result of labor market failures since the labor market is functioning, but seems more of a response to the high cost of hired labor, which is a market response to the low price of land as described in the preceding section. The wage sectors are ‘’thinly’’ populated and individuals who supply labor, mainly non-indigenes, receive high wages. In response to the high level of wages, there is evidence from the community that households with small farmlands typically solely engage household labor, while richer households (in terms of amount of land they own) hire wage labor in order to cultivate beyond the strength of the household."

    "text": "2.4 Consumption Sharing and Kin Networks\nA key structural difference between the communities is the extent to which kinship affiliation determines households’ access to productive resources. While individual households retain full ownership rights over their land in the private community, access to land is regulated at the clan level under communal tenure.\nConsumption smoothing mechanisms and income sharing under cooperative resource ownership is notably associated with relatively cohesive kin networks. Local networks provide the basis and support to city networks. A growing body of literature has documented the importance of networks in job markets4 in developing countries (Munshi and Luke, 2003; Barr et al, 1999). Although there are no differences in employment opportunities in the cities on the basis of community of origin, variations in the quality of networks are sources of remarkable differences in the rate at which job opportunities are accessible and therefore constitutes a significant determinand of the returns to investment in skills. With good networks, individuals are able to access information about opportunities that bad networks are unable to access.\nFrom another perspective of the cost of education, strong networks in communities might lower the cost of education either by means of community efforts in assisting school construction projects5 or through the channel of kin or clan members contributions to the cost of child schooling either directly in monetary contributions or through the avenue of cooperative labor obviating child labor6 . While the cost of schooling factor will strengthen the returns to skill acquisition factor, I emphasize the role of incentives and therefore will not attempt to isolate the cost effect differently from the returns effect."

    "text": "3.1 Household Labor Supply Decisions\nThe rural economy consists of two sectors; the farmland sector and the non-farm wage sector. Each household is endowed with an amount of land \\(k_h\\) and household labor \\(l_{h}.\\) Farm production inputs are land and labor and production exhibits constant returns to scale. In each community, households make their labor supply decisions, landowners make their labor demand and the labor market clears. Each household may allocate a fraction \\(% f_{i}\\) of household labor on household farm and the remaining \\(1-f_{i}\\) in the non-farm wage sector. We rule out the possibility of a household supplying wage labor and hiring laborers at the same time. Since communal households are allocated farmland on the basis of size we assume a fixed amount of land per capita for households in the communal society but alow it to vary under market ownership.We rule out the possibility of a household supplying wage labor and hiring laborers at the same time. Since communal households are allocated farmland on the basis of size we assume a fixed amount of land per capita for households in the communal society but alow it to vary under market ownership.\nProduction function follows the constant returns to scale Cobb-Douglas form. Income from farm activities is given by \\(y_{f}=k^{\\alpha }(f\\) \\(l)^{1-\\alpha },\\) normalizing the price of output \\(p=1\\) while income from non-farm employment is \\(y_{n}=w(1-f)l\\) where \\(w\\) is the wage rate per unit of time. The wage rate is taken as given by individual households. Therefore total household income is given by the expression:\n\\[ y=k^\\alpha (f \\space{} l)^{1-\\alpha} + w(1-f)l  \\tag{1}\\] assume utility is linear in income and each household maximizes total income from its allocation of labor resources. Maximizing \\(y\\) with respect to \\(f\\) yields the first order condition that requires\n\\[\n(1-\\alpha)k^{ck} (f\\space{} l)^{\\alpha} = w\n\\tag{2}\\]\nSolving this equation completely and making the substitution \\(c=\\frac{k}{l}\\) gives the solution\n\\[\nf=1-\\alpha\\omega^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}c\n\\tag{3}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is the amount of land per capita for the household.\nThus the fraction of household labor employed on the farm is an increasing function of the amount of land per capita available to the household, and it decreases with the level of wages in the non-farm sector. Under communal ownership household land per capita is fixed at \\(c=\\pi\\). We can understand the outcomes more fully by examining household responses to variations in the parameters of the above equation.\nUnder communal rights, increase or decrease in wages translate into labor allocations directly since there are no means of adjusting \\(c\\). Labor supply elasticity with respect to wage is given by\n\\[\n\\xi_w= \\frac{\\partial{logf}} {\\partial{logw}} = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIf wages increase households supply more off-farm labor and vice versa. Under private ownership, landholding adjustment can more or less than compensate changes in wages on account of land abundance and the market. Given little or absence of shocks to agriculture, the elasticity of labor supply depends on the ease with which landholding can be adjusted in response to changes in wages.\nLabor supply is unitarily elastic with respect to changes in landholding per capita, that is,\n\\[\n\\xi_c=\\frac{\\partial{logf}}{\\partial{logc}}=1\n\\tag{5}\\]\nIf the amount of landholding doubles, given household size and wage, then the fraction of household labor that goes into the farm doubles at the profit mazimization allocation. Thus under private ownership where landowning per capita can be adjusted, for given wage rate in the non-farm sector, household will put more of its labor on the farm in as much as it can cultivate more farmlands and might increase it until \\(f\\) reaches \\(1\\). To cultivate beyond its strength a household would hire wage workers.\nAt the optimal labor allocation just examined, the relationship between the marginal product of labor (MPL) on the farmland and wage in the non-farm sector is given by the following equation:\n\\[\nMPL=\\frac{\\partial{y}}{\\partial{t}} = (1-\\alpha)k^\\alpha(f\\space l)^{-\\alpha}f\n\\tag{6}\\]\nand by substituting for \\(w\\) from the first order condition in the above equation we obtain:\n\\[\nMLP=w\\space f \\iff \\frac{MPL}{f}=w\n\\tag{7}\\]\nwhich implies that at optimal household labor allocation, the marginal product of labor expressed per unit of time of labor employed on the farmland equates the wage rate in the non-farm sector."

    "section": "3.2 Individual Abilities and Career Choice",
    "text": "3.2 Individual Abilities and Career Choice\nGiven the household labor supply decision, this section identifies who works on the farmland and who goes into the wage sector. Here individuals are endowed with ability \\(\\omega _{i}\\) which has a distribution in the household. For simplicity let \\(\\omega \\subset[0,1]\\). The factors of production remain land and labor. However, labor productivity is a measure function of ability i.e. \\(l=l(\\omega )\\) where \\(l^{\\prime }(\\omega )&gt;0\\) and household income depends on the deployment of its abilities. Farm production function is constant in returns to scale. Households make their decisions on the basis of expected wages in the non-farm sector, which depends on the abilities deployed away from the farm. In each community, households make their labor supply decisions, landowners and non-farm employers make their labor demand and the labor market clears. Normalize household labor to one unit. Income from farm production is given by \\(y_f=k^{\\alpha}(l(\\omega))^{1-\\alpha}\\)while non-farm income is \\(y_n=wl(\\omega^\\prime)\\), where \\(l(\\omega )\\) and \\(l(\\omega ^{\\prime })\\) are ability adjusted labor allocations to the farm and wage sectors respectively, where \\(\\omega \\cup \\omega ^{\\prime }=\\left[ 0,1\\right] ,\\) and \\(w=w(\\omega^\\prime)\\) is the wage rate that individuals with ability level \\(\\omega ^{\\prime }\\) can earn. From the structure, if \\(\\omega\\) rises, \\(\\omega^\\prime\\)must necessary fall. Total household income is thus\n\\[\ny=y_f + y_n = k^\\alpha(l(\\omega))^{1-\\alpha} + \\omega(\\omega{\\prime})l(\\omega{\\prime)}\n\\tag{8}\\]\nWhen the farm income is expressed in per capita terms we have\n\\[\ny=\\left(\\frac{k}{l(\\omega)}\\right)^\\alpha  l(\\omega) + \\omega(\\omega^\\prime)l(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{9}\\]\nLand per capita is given by \\(c(\\omega)= \\frac{k}{l(\\omega)+l(\\omega^\\prime)}\\), therefore substituting \\(k=c(\\omega)[l(\\omega)+l(\\omega^\\prime)]\\) in the above equation gives\n\\[\ny= \\left(\\frac{c(\\omega)[l(\\omega)+l(\\omega^\\prime)]}{l(\\omega)}\\right)^\\alpha l(\\omega)+ \\omega(\\omega^\\prime)l(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{10}\\]\n\\[\ny=\\{c(\\omega)[1+\\delta(\\omega)]\\}^\\alpha l(\\omega) + \\omega(\\omega^\\prime)l(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{11}\\]\nby making the substitution \\(\\frac{l(\\omega^\\prime)}{l(\\omega =)}= \\delta(\\omega) \\in(0,\\infty).\\) The expression provides household income as a function of the distribution of household ability endowment in the farm and wage sectors where \\(c^\\prime(\\omega)&lt;0, \\delta^\\prime(\\omega)&lt;0,\\omega^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)&lt;0,l^\\prime(\\omega)&gt;0, and\\space l^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)&lt;0\\). The function \\(\\delta(\\omega)\\) is theratio of ability adjusted labor productivity in the complement set toability adjusted productivity at the chosen set. Thus if \\(\\omega\\) is low ability, then the complement set is high ability and therefore the ratio of productivity can be very large whereas for the reverse case the ratio will be very small.\nDifferentiating the total income with respect to ability engaged on the farm we obtain the following expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{d\\omega}= \\left[\\frac{\\alpha lc^\\alpha}{(1+\\delta)^{1-\\alpha}}\\right] \\delta^\\prime + \\left[\\frac{\\alpha l(1+\\delta)^\\alpha}{c^{1-\\alpha}} \\right]c^\\prime +[c(1+\\delta)]^\\alpha l^\\prime(\\omega) + l\\omega^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime) + \\omega l^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{12}\\]\nThis expression is difficult to solve for the value of \\(\\omega\\) that sets it to zero. However, the sign of the expression can indicate on which side of the optimum we are at given levels of \\(\\omega\\). We know that if \\(\\frac{dy}{d\\omega}\\) is positive for all values of \\(\\omega\\), then the household should employ the high ability on the farmland since income is not maximized yet. On the other hand, if the expression is negative for all values of \\(\\omega\\), then households should employ its low abilities on the farmland and deploy the higher abilities to off-farm activities since household income is maximixed at low levels of \\(\\omega\\) deployed to the farm. The first expression is negative since \\(\\delta^\\prime(\\omega) &lt;0.\\) Likewise, the last two expressions are negative because they are functions of \\(\\omega^\\prime\\) which are being differentiated with respect to \\(\\omega\\). The third is positive since differentiating \\(l(\\omega)\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\) is positive. However the sign of the second term depends on whether \\(c^\\prime(\\omega)&lt;0\\), or \\(c^\\prime(\\omega)&gt;0\\) or \\(c^\\prime(\\omega)=0\\). That is, whether household land per capita is positively or negatively or completely unrelated to ability.\nThe major difference between the two communities is that while household farmland is ability biased under market ownership, it is population (headcount) biased in the communal society. Therefore we will expect that \\(c^\\prime(\\omega)\\) is essentially positive under market ownership but is zero under communal landholding.\nWhen the above expression is simplified we obtain the following:\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{d\\omega}= \\alpha lc^\\alpha(1+\\delta)^\\alpha \\left[\\frac{\\delta^\\prime}{(1+\\delta)} + \\frac{c^\\prime}{c} + \\frac{l^\\prime}{\\alpha l} \\right] + l(\\omega^\\prime) \\omega^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime) + \\omega(\\omega^\\prime)l^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{13}\\]\nThe terms\\(\\frac{\\delta^\\prime}{1+\\delta}\\) and \\(\\frac{l^\\prime}{\\alpha l}\\) in the expression represent the decline in labor productivity and growth in labor efficiency respectively as ability increases. Since these are opposing forces we may safely assume that they cancel out since households are efficient in deploying their abilities. Under this assumption we are left with only the growth of land per capita in the household as ability increases in the large parenthesis. The growth of land per capita in response to improvement in ability is an obvious reality where market for land exists in a land abundant society whereas such growth is unlikely under communal system. Simplifying further under the assumption, the expression becomes\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{d\\omega} = \\alpha lc^\\alpha (1+\\delta)^\\alpha \\frac{c^\\prime}{c} + l(\\omega^\\prime) \\space \\omega^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)+ \\omega(\\omega^\\prime)l^\\prime(\\omega^\\prime)\n\\tag{14}\\]\nUnder the communal system, \\(\\frac{c^\\prime}{c}=0\\) and thus the first term disappears leaving us with the last two terms which are both negative. The implication here is that the slope of the income function is negative in ability for all values of \\(\\omega\\) . Therefore households welfare improves when household members with low abilities are left on the farm while the more able members engage in non-wage employment. Under the market ownership system where \\(\\frac{c^\\prime}{c}&gt;0\\) i.e where the amount of land per capita can grow positively in the household the first term is positive. Notice that the coefficient of \\(\\frac{c^\\prime}{c}\\) is \\(\\alpha y f\\), that is, land share of total farm output. Soil natural fertility as it exists in the forest zone raises the productivity of land relative to labor and might raise the value of \\(\\alpha\\). If wage rates are time related rather than ability related then the middle term will be zero. The assumption of a smooth ability function also makes the last term really small. In effect given the parameters of the model, the first term dominates the expression and therefore the resulting expression may be positive, requiring welfare maximizing households to invest the best of their ability on the farmland."

This is the private cost which is inversely related to ability. The next is the influence of migration which brings about frequent contacts with outsiders and determines exposure to diffusion of ideas. The last is the network effect which raises the returns to schooling on one hand and lowers the cost of schooling on the other."

Similarly, τ_ij the cost of skill (which equals return to skill) decreases with the level of skill but increases with the level of technology of the firm, and is the primary source of complementarity in the model. Given the returns, entrepreneur’s wage income is given by the sum of profit (return to his labor) and returns to skill, which simplifies to output minus the total cost of capital,\n\\[\nw_{ij} = f(h_i,k_j )-r(h_i,k_j ) k_j=αAh_i^α k_j^{1-\\alpha}\\tag{3c}\n\\]\nIn the Walrasian equilibrium, it must be the case that the marginal product of capital is equal to the capitalist’s required rate of return on capital, that is, \\({(1-\\alpha)}Ah_i^{\\alpha}k_j^{-\\alpha}=\\mu\\) .

The constancy of capital-skill ratio in this equilibrium implies that output and wages increase progressively with the level of technology (or capital) while the costs of capital and skill remain constant for all levels of skill.\nProposition 1\n\nThere exists a unique Walrasian equilibrium where the skill investments are given by equation (6) and all enterprises have a constant capital to skill ratio given by equation (4).\nThe equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal.\nThe rate of return on skill is independent of the relative disutility of skill acquisition δ."

Although the matching capital increases \\((∂k_i⁄∂μ>0),\\) it does so less than skill because \\((1-Γ)(1-α)⁄αΓ-1<(1-α)⁄αΓ\\) for any \\(Γ>0.\\) Thus, the capital-skill ratio decreases (observe also from (4) that \\((∂κ_ij⁄∂μ<0),\\) wages increase in absolute terms but decreases in relative (to skill) terms. In effect, as the required rate of return to capital increases, there is over investment skills, which reduces the capital-skill ratio and drives down returns to investment in skills. Given that \\(∂^2 κ_ij⁄∂μ^2 >0\\) from equation (4), the capital-skill ratio decreases and the capital deficit widens rapidly as the cost of capital increases. This outcome is inefficient because entrepreneurs with skill below a threshold will not find capital while capital sizes larger than threshold will lie idle.\nWe have assumed in the preceding analysis that the stock of capital supplied to the enterprise market is fixed, and does not increase with the cost of capital. Suppose the stock of capital is variable in order to allow the capital-skill ratio remain fixed at the constant rate \\(k_{ij}=\\bar{k}.\\) Then the equilibrium described by equation (4) and equation (6) is restored with the effect that capital and skill distribution both shift upwards, leading to higher output. However, wages do not respond to changes in the cost of capital.\nProposition 2\n\nSuppose the required rate of return to capital is an increasing function of the stock of capital \\(μ=μ(K)\\) in the Walrasian auctioneering market and the capital-skill ratio is constant \\(κ_ij=κ ̅.\\) Then wages are non-responsive to the cost of capital.\nThe equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal.\n\nIn the transition described in proposition 2, the increase in equilibrium level of skill could be the outcome of two processes: (1) a general increase in the level of skills compared to the market with lower cost of capital, or (2) a mechanism that sorts low-skill workers, who would not be able to generate the higher required rate of return on capital, out of the entrepreneurship market. This sorting could be into wage employment during increasing wages, or sorting into unemployment. While the former mechanism does not provide any insight into how the rate of entrepreneurship changes with wage levels, the latter presents a case of negative correlation between the rate of entrepreneurship and wages conditional on flexible enterprise capital stock."

We first examine a decentralized equilibrium with random matching. In this case, entrepreneurs and capitalists still make their investment decisions at time \\(t=0\\) and engage in production in period \\(t=1,\\) but capitalists and entrepreneurs are allocated to each other through a random matching technology. Entrepreneurs do not know which capitalist they will match with, neither do capitalists know which entrepreneur they will be matched with. An entrepreneur is equally likely to be matched with any capitalist, and so is a capitalist equally likely to be matched with any entrepreneur. In effect, the entrepreneur assumes that he faces a production function of the form \\(f(h_i,\\{k_j\\})=Ah_i^{\\alpha}{\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}P(j)dj\\) while the capitalist assumes that the production function is \\(f(\\{h_i\\},k_j)=A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)k_j^{1-\\alpha}\\) where \\(p(j)\\) and \\(p(i)\\) are the probabilities of matching with capitalist \\(j\\) and entrepreneur \\(i\\) respectively.

However, the natural equilibrium where capitalists choose the same investment and entrepreneurs choose identical level of skill is not very insightful or different from the Walrasian equilibrium.\n\n3.3.1 The case of uniform distribution of capital and exogenous cost of capital\nConsider the specific case where all capitalists choose the same size of capital, so that \\(k_j=k ̅,\\) but skills vary across entrepreneurs. This scenario is relevant in order to analyze the functioning of capital markets where programs allocate flat amount of capital to entrepreneurs. Although all entrepreneurs receive equal allocation of capital, the amount of capital offered in the market is the level of capital that will be commensurate for the median entrepreneur in the Walrasian market. In this particular case, \\({\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}p(j)dj={\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}{\\int}p(j)dj={\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}\\), and the returns to factor inputs are\n\\[\nr_{ij}=f_k(\\{h_i\\},\\bar{k})={(1-\\alpha})A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di){\\bar{k}^{-\\alpha}} \\tag{9a}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij}=f_h(h_i,{\\bar{k}})={\\alpha}Ah_i^{\\alpha-1}\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{9b}\n\\]\nwhile entrepreneur’s total income is given by\n\\[\nw_{ij}={\\alpha}Ah_i^{\\alpha}\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}+({1-\\alpha})A(h_i^{\\alpha}-{\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{9c}\n\\]\nGiven a required rate of return to capital of μ, the equilibrium condition in the decentralized equilibrium is given by \\(({1-\\alpha})A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di){\\bar{k}^{-\\alpha}}=\\mu\\). The solution to this equation yields the expression:\n\\[\n{\\bar{k}}/h_i=[({1-{\\alpha}})A/\\mu]^{1/{\\alpha}}[({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}]^{1/\\alpha} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nIn comparison with the Walrasian equilibrium, the ratio of capital to skill is no longer constant, but depends on the skill of the individual subscript i and the distribution of skill in the entire market through the ratio \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\). Entrepreneurs with skill higher than the average in the population of entrepreneurs would have capital to skill ratio that is lower than the Walrasian outcome while entrepreneurs with skill lower than the average would have capital to skill ratio that is higher than the Walrasian level, and the capital-skill gap would widen the father the entrepreneur’s skill is away from the average. This is not surprising; it is rather expected from a uniform distribution of capital over a range of skills.\nTo observe how wages are affected by the distribution of skill, (9c) can be re-written as\n\\[\nw_{ij} = \\underbrace{\\alpha A h_i^\\alpha \\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}_{Q} + \\underbrace{(1-\\alpha) A h_i^\\alpha \\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\left[1 - \\frac{\\left(\\int h_i^\\alpha p(i) \\, di\\right)}{h_i^\\alpha}\\right]}_{R} \\tag{9c}\n\\]\nwhich is a sum of two parts Q and R. Under the Walrasian auctioneer, entrepreneurs with skill higher than (lower than) the average are matched with capital higher than (lower than) the average so that \\((h_i⋚h ̅⟺k_j⋚k ̅ ).\\) Under the matching rule under consideration here, every entrepreneur is matched with a constant size of capital, leading wage to decrease (increase) in wages for above-average (below-average) workers through Q in equation (9c) relative to the Walrasian outcome in equation (3c). However, there is another effect through the second term. Wages also increase because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i< 1\\) (decreases because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha} >1)\\) through R for entrepreneurs with skills higher than (lower than) the average person. In essence, the net effect of switching from the Walrasian auctioneer to a random matching with uniform distribution of capital on wages depends on the relativity of these changes based on the shape of skill distribution.\nConsider a skill distribution that is skewed to the right. The gap between skill and capital will be large for the highly skilled, thus reducing the value of Q substantially. For the second component R, the value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)h_i\\) will be smaller than one but close to one so that the right hand side contributes little by way of increase. On a net basis, wages will fall for the highly skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. With regards to the low-skill entrepreneur, although Q increases substantially, the increase is more than offset by the large negative value of R induced by a large value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i >1\\), leading to lower wages relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. Thus, wages are lower for both high-skill and low-skill individuals under a random matching and uniform distribution of capital than under the Walrasian allocation.\nIf, on the other hand, skill distribution is sufficiently skewed to the left, the capital-skill gap for the highly skilled entrepreneur is lower relative to the case under the right-skewed distribution but is still larger relative to the Walrasian allocation. So, Q will be lower than under the Walrasian auctioneering outcome. However, the second component will increase significantly because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\) will be small. On a net basis, wages will increase for the skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. For the low-skill entrepreneur, Q will increase substantially relative to the Walrasian allocation and the value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\) will be close to one so that the right hand side contributes little by way of decrease. On a net basis, wages will also increase for the low-skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. Indeed, as noted at the beginning of this subsection, the finding that different shapes of skill distribution yield different wages for the same worker is driven by sensitivity of the (uniform) level of capital to the median level of skill.\nIt is important to characterize this outcome further. The ratio of wage to skill, or the return to (or cost of) skills, obtained by substituting (10) into (9b) yields the following expression:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij} = \\underbrace{\\left( \\alpha A \\left[ \\left(1-\\alpha\\right) \\frac{A}{\\mu} \\right]^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} \\right)}_{\\tau_W} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\left[ \\frac{\\int h_i^{\\alpha} p(i)di}{h_i^{\\alpha}} \\right]^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} \\right)}_{\\tau_M} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhich is a product of the constant cost of skills under Walrasian allocation (τ_W ) and a multiplier represented by \\((τ_M ).\\) Thus, the cost of skills diverges by level of skill relative to the population average. The first observation from equation (11) is that, regardless of the skill distribution, \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i>1\\) for low-skill entrepreneurs and \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di<1\\) for high-skilled entrepreneurs. Therefore, compared to the Walrasian equilibrium, the cost of skill (re return to skill) is higher for entrepreneurs with skills below the average and lower for entrepreneurs with skills above the population average. In effect, the cost of skills (return to skills) rises for low-skill entrepreneurs and falls for high skill entrepreneurs if we replace the Walrasian equilibrium with the decentralized equilibrium with uniform distribution of capital and random matching. The second observation is that return to skill rises for both high-skilled and low-skilled entrepreneurs as we move from a right-skewed distribution to a left-skewed distribution of skills because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)\\) increases as a result. In effect, return to skills rises for everyone as the average level of skill rises in the population. When the two factors are combined, the low-skilled entrepreneurs benefit more in terms of return to skill under a left-skewed distribution than a right skewed distribution. This captures a form of social returns to skill that has been emphasized by Acemoglu (1996) – see page 787 of the article.\nWhy are wages higher under uniform distribution of capital compared to the Walrasian efficient allocation rule when skill distribution is left-skewed but lower when skill distribution is right-skewed? Given that the cost of capital is exogenous, there are two explanatory factors. One, the amount of capital supplied to the market rises with the median level of skill, so that capital per entrepreneur is higher under the left-skewed skill distribution than under the right-skewed distribution. “As the cost of education falls for a group of workers, the stock of skill in the economy increases, and firms want to increase their capital (p.787)” Thus, low-skill entrepreneurs benefit in terms of higher levels of capital induced by the high level of median skill when skill distribution is left-skewed than they would be allocated under the Walrasian rule. Second, a right-skewed skill distribution yields little for the low-skill entrepreneur in terms of capital increase with the change of rule, and any such benefit from capital is outweighed by the decrease in returns to skill, leading to lower wages. For high-skilled entrepreneurs, reduction in return to skills associated with the right-skewed distribution is reinforced by large reduction in capital.\nProposition 3\n\nSuppose the matching technology allocates capital uniformly to entrepreneurs, \\(k_j=k ̅(h ̈ ),\\) where \\(h ̈∈ {(h^L,h^H)}\\) is the level of skill chosen by entrepreneurs.\nThe equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^H\\) where capital to skill ratio is given by equation (10) is efficient and wages given by equation (9c) is preferred to the Walrasian equilibrium described by equation (6) and equation (4).\nThe equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^L\\) where capital to skill ratio is given by equation (10) is inefficient and wages given byequation (9c) is worse than the Walrasian equilibrium described by (7f).\n\nThe foregoing implies that when the stock of capital is flexible under random matching with uniform distribution of capital so that average capital increases with average (median) level of skill, entrepreneurs earn higher wages when the population of entrepreneurs is high-skilled on average and lower wages when the population is low-skilled. This scenario leads to multiple equilibria where wages are lower than the Walrasian equilibrium in the equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^L\\)and are higher in the equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^H\\) whereas the cost of capital, capital-skill ratio and cost of skill are constant and the same as the Walrasian equilibrium."

    "text": "3.4 Decentralized equilibrium with endogenous cost of capital\nWe discard the assumption of uniform distribution of capital and consider the case where matching is random (large number of lenders and borrowers) and the required rate of return on capital is a decreasing function of entrepreneur’s skill. That is, \\(μ=μ(h_i ).\\) For simplicity, we assume that \\(μ=θ⁄h_i\\) . Solving \\(({1-\\alpha}A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)p(i)di)k_j^{-\\alpha}={\\theta}/h_i\\) yields\n\\[\n\\frac{k_j}{h_i} = \\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) A}{\\theta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} \\left(\\frac{\\left(\\int h_i^{\\alpha} p(i) \\, di\\right)}{(h_i^{\\alpha}) \\cdot h_i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nIn this case, the capital to skill ratio is determined by the entrepreneur’s both relative and absolute levels of skill. A high-skill entrepreneur in a population with high average level of skill will have very high capital to skill ratio relative to the Walrasian outcome, while a low-skill entrepreneur in a population of entrepreneurs with low average skill will have very low capital to skill ratio relative to the Walrasian rule. In the former, the high average skill will attract high levels of capital that are typically cheaper to administer, and the entrepreneur’s high skill will further reduce the cost of capital thereby enabling him to demand large size of capital. In the latter case, the low average skill attracts low level of capital, which is typically more costly. The entrepreneur’s own low skill level further raises the cost, ensuring that his demand for capital will be low. Otherwise, a high-skill entrepreneur in a population with low average skill and a low-skill entrepreneur in a population with high average skill may have similar ratios of capital to skill. The capital-skill ratio will be the most dispersed among the matching rules considered so far. Because larger sizes of loan are typically less expensive to administer in reality relative to small loans, this is likely to mirror the system in well-developed credit markets. An analysis of equation (12) shows that the allocation is characterized by an indefinite number of equilibria. Suppose, instead, that such unique equilibrium level of skill exists. From equation (12), although \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}=1\\), the resulting capital skill ratio which simplifies to \\(k_j/h_i=[{(1-\\alpha)}A/\\theta]^{1/{\\alpha}}\\) depends on the level of skill. Because this is not the same for everyone who chooses the same level of skill, then there is no unique equilibrium. The problem could be modified if the cost of capital is a step function. In that case, there could be up to twice as many equilibria as the number of steps once we incorporate skill distribution. It is possible that the standard credit market has a matching technology that generates a finite number of equilibria, each with unique realization of wages and constant capital-skills ratio."

    "section": "2.1 Preferences",
    "text": "2.1 Preferences\nThe utility of a member is determined by the quantity of all the n goods produced in the family\n\\[\nU = U(c_1,c_2,...,c_n) \\tag{1}\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_i\\) depends on \\(g_i\\). The amount of goods consumed by an individual depends on the quantity of goods available for consumption to the group and the number of persons who will share in its benefits, including the individual whose utility is being examined. Two goods may be identical in nature but produced in different households. Such goods are stated as different goods in the utility function. This is a result of differences in production-consumption configuration of the goods. For example, child services provided by children raised in a particular household are treated as separate from those provided by children raised in another household in the group. Although children may provide similar old-age consumption to adults, for example, these goods differ in their production-consumption configuration. Thus\n\\[\nc_i = c(g_i,t^c_i) \\tag{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(g_i\\) represents both the quantity and services flowing from good \\(i\\) and \\(t^c_i=[t_{(i,j)}^c]_{1\\times n}\\) is a vector of the good’s consumption time. Each component \\(t^c_{i,j}\\) represents the fraction of time good \\(i\\) is consumed by household \\(j\\). The sum of the elements of this vector yields the number of persons that share in consuming the good. Our specification has not assumed any particular manner of sharing. The production function for \\(g_i\\) is given by\n\\[\ng_i=g_i (x_i,t_i^p) \\tag{3}\n\\]\nwhere \\(x_i=[x_{i,j}]_{1×n}\\) is a vector of aggregate market goods allocated by household \\(j=1,2,...n\\) to production of good \\(i\\). In addition to market inputs, the quantity of good i produced depends on the number of persons who contribute to its production. The specification we assume here is that \\(t_i^p=[t_{i,j}^p]_{1×n}\\) where each component \\(t^p_{i,j}\\) represents the fraction of time endowment that household \\(j\\) contributes to production of good \\(i\\). Again, summing the elements of this vector provides the number of persons that contribute to its production. For example, production of an agricultural good depends on farm inputs and family labor. Production of human capital in children requires input of market goods as well as adults’ time.\nWe exclude the possibility of joint production in respect of market input goods but allow for joint production in respect of time allocation. For example, the amount of food allocated to a child is consumed solely by that child, but adult time spent with children may jointly improve the quality of two or more children at the same time. This is the essence of joint child-rearing that is often observed in lineage-based societies. No resources are wasted; every household allocates all resources into producing goods and services in the group.\nIn order to simplify the analysis, we make the assumption that production exhibits constant returns to scale in labor, so that \\(g_i=t_i^pf(x_i)\\). Combining equations (2) and (3), the amount of good \\(i\\) consumed by an individual is given by\n\\[\nc_i=c(g_i (x_i,t_i^p),t_i^c)=c(t_i^p f(x_i),t_i^c). \\tag{4}\n\\]\nThe sizes of the production and consumption groups for each commodity combine to endogenously determine the “domestic” price of each good. This price increases as the size of the consumption group increases, and decreases as the production group increases in size. It is straightforward to note that higher domestic prices result in low per-capita consumption of that good whereas goods with low domestic prices are consumed at high levels per-capita. Define the metric\n\\[\nd_i = d_i (t_i^c,t_i^p)= \\frac{i⋅t_i^c}{i⋅t_i^p} = \\frac{∑_{j=1}^n t_{i,j}^c}{∑_{j=1}^nt_{i,j}^p} = \\frac {N_i^c}{N_i^p }\\tag{5}\n\\]\nthe ratio of consumption group to producer group as the domestic price that possesses the above characteristics. Goods that are publicly consumed would have endogenous prices of \\(d_i&gt;1\\) . In effect, \\(d_i\\) is a measure of the publicness in the consumption of the good. If \\(d_i =0\\) then the good is not produced because there are no consumers for it. When \\(0&lt;d_i&lt;1\\), more members contribute to producing the good than to consuming it. When \\(d_i=1\\), equal numbers of members consume the good as those producing it, and such goods are likely to be privately produced and consumed. When \\(1&lt;d_I&lt;\\infty\\), consumers exceed producers of the good, therefore those goods are publicly consumed. Defining these prices in the consumption set yields\n\\[\nc_i=c_i[f(x_i),d_i] \\tag{6}\n\\]\nThe structure of equation (6) is quite intuitive. Consumption of a good by an individual depends on allocation of aggregate market goods to its production, the number of people sharing in its consumption and number of people contributing to its production. Addition of members to the production group reduces the price to each member and makes more of the good available, thereby increasing individual consumption. On the other hand, addition to the consumer group reduces the amount of consumption available to each consumer and raises the price of the good to each individual."

The underlying mechanism is the matching of capital and skills in the capital market through interaction of the required rate of return on capital, the distribution of skills in the population, and the mechanism shifting the skill distribution. The model shows that the stylized observation is driven by a particular matching rule, rather than the general rule, and is not necessarily a manifestation of disequilibrium. We proceed to conduct empirical tests of the implications of the model."

    "text": "3.1 The Auctioneer Walrasian Allocation\nUnder frictionless Walrasian markets managed by an auctioneer, the equilibrium matching of capital and entrepreneur’s skill will be one-to-one according to their corresponding rankings in the unit interval. That is, high tech capital will be matched with high entrepreneurial skill and the most skilled entrepreneur will be matched with the largest size of capital. In this market, all agents are paid their marginal products:\n\\[\nr_{ij} = f_k(h_i,k_j)=(1-\\alpha)Ah_i^{\\alpha}k_j^{-\\alpha} \\tag{3a}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij} = f_h(h_i,k_j)={\\alpha}Ah_i^{\\alpha-1}k_j^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{3b}\n\\]\nAs in standard models, return to capital falls with the level of input. Similarly, \\(\\tau_{i,j}\\) the cost of skill (which equals return to skill) decreases with the level of skill but increases with the level of technology of the firm, and is the primary source of complementarity in the model. Given the returns, entrepreneur’s wage income is given by the sum of profit (return to his labor) and returns to skill, which simplifies to output minus the total cost of capital,\n\\[\nw_{ij} = f(h_i,k_j )-r(h_i,k_j ) k_j=αAh_i^α k_j^{1-\\alpha}\\tag{3c}\n\\]\nIn the Walrasian equilibrium, it must be the case that the marginal product of capital is equal to the capitalist’s required rate of return on capital, that is, \\({(1-\\alpha)}Ah_i^{\\alpha}k_j^{-\\alpha}=\\mu\\) . The solution of the equation yields the capital-skill ratio given by the expression:\n\\[\nk_{ij} = k_j/h_i=[{(1-\\alpha)}A/\\mu]^{1/\\alpha} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nIn equilibrium, all enterprises exhibit constant ratio of capital to skill, and both entrepreneurs and capitalists have no incentive to break up a match once it is formed. The optimal level of skill acquired by the entrepreneur is obtained by maximizing his utility in equation (2) subject to the condition that \\(c_i=w_ij=αAh_i^α k_j^{1-α}.\\) The utility maximization process yields:\n\\[\n{\\alpha}^2Ah_i^{\\alpha-1}k_j^{1-\\alpha}=h_i^{-\\Gamma}/\\delta \\tag{5}\n\\]\nSubstituting (4) into (5), the optimal acquisition of skill by the entrepreneur is given by:\n\\[\nh_i=[{\\mu}/({1-\\alpha})^{{1-\\alpha}/\\alpha}{\\alpha}^{-2}{\\delta}^{-1}A^{-1/\\alpha}]^{1/\\Gamma} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nthe matching level of capital is given by equation (4).\nUnder this matching technology, all firms face identical cost of skills (the cost of learning the use of incremental addition to capital or alternatively the cost of the learning required to use new technology), and are therefore able to take advantage of them without anyone falling behind or getting ahead of others. In effect, all firms benefit similarly from technological improvements. The constancy of capital-skill ratio in this equilibrium implies that output and wages increase progressively with the level of technology (or capital) while the costs of capital and skill remain constant for all levels of skill.\nProposition 1\n\nThere exists a unique Walrasian equilibrium where the skill investments are given by equation (6) and all enterprises have a constant capital to skill ratio given by equation (4).\nThe equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal.\nThe rate of return on skill is independent of the relative disutility of skill acquisition δ."

Although the matching capital increases \\((∂k_i⁄∂μ&gt;0),\\) it does so less than skill because \\((1-Γ)(1-α)⁄αΓ-1&lt;(1-α)⁄αΓ\\) for any \\(Γ&gt;0.\\) Thus, the capital-skill ratio decreases (observe also from (4) that \\((∂κ_ij⁄∂μ&lt;0),\\) wages increase in absolute terms but decreases in relative (to skill) terms. In effect, as the required rate of return to capital increases, there is over investment skills, which reduces the capital-skill ratio and drives down returns to investment in skills. Given that \\(∂^2 κ_ij⁄∂μ^2 &gt;0\\) from equation (4), the capital-skill ratio decreases and the capital deficit widens rapidly as the cost of capital increases. This outcome is inefficient because entrepreneurs with skill below a threshold will not find capital while capital sizes larger than threshold will lie idle.\nWe have assumed in the preceding analysis that the stock of capital supplied to the enterprise market is fixed, and does not increase with the cost of capital. Suppose the stock of capital is variable in order to allow the capital-skill ratio remain fixed at the constant rate \\(k_{ij}=\\bar{k}.\\) Then the equilibrium described by equation (4) and equation (6) is restored with the effect that capital and skill distribution both shift upwards, leading to higher output. However, wages do not respond to changes in the cost of capital.\nProposition 2\n\nSuppose the required rate of return to capital is an increasing function of the stock of capital \\(μ=μ(K)\\) in the Walrasian auctioneering market and the capital-skill ratio is constant \\(κ_ij=κ ̅.\\) Then wages are non-responsive to the cost of capital.\nThe equilibrium allocation is Pareto optimal.\n\nIn the transition described in proposition 2, the increase in equilibrium level of skill could be the outcome of two processes: (1) a general increase in the level of skills compared to the market with lower cost of capital, or (2) a mechanism that sorts low-skill workers, who would not be able to generate the higher required rate of return on capital, out of the entrepreneurship market. This sorting could be into wage employment during increasing wages, or sorting into unemployment. While the former mechanism does not provide any insight into how the rate of entrepreneurship changes with wage levels, the latter presents a case of negative correlation between the rate of entrepreneurship and wages conditional on flexible enterprise capital stock."

    "section": "3.3 Decentralized equilibrium with random matching and exogenous cost of capital",
    "text": "3.3 Decentralized equilibrium with random matching and exogenous cost of capital\nWe now replace the Walrasian auctioneer with other mechanisms of matching entrepreneurs with capitalists. We first examine a decentralized equilibrium with random matching. In this case, entrepreneurs and capitalists still make their investment decisions at time \\(t=0\\) and engage in production in period \\(t=1,\\) but capitalists and entrepreneurs are allocated to each other through a random matching technology. Entrepreneurs do not know which capitalist they will match with, neither do capitalists know which entrepreneur they will be matched with. An entrepreneur is equally likely to be matched with any capitalist, and so is a capitalist equally likely to be matched with any entrepreneur. In effect, the entrepreneur assumes that he faces a production function of the form \\(f(h_i,\\{k_j\\})=Ah_i^{\\alpha}{\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}P(j)dj\\) while the capitalist assumes that the production function is \\(f(\\{h_i\\},k_j)=A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)k_j^{1-\\alpha}\\) where \\(p(j)\\) and \\(p(i)\\) are the probabilities of matching with capitalist \\(j\\) and entrepreneur \\(i\\) respectively. The expected returns to inputs are\n\\[\nr_{ij}=f_k(\\{h_i\\},k_j)=({1-\\alpha})A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)k_j^{\\alpha} \\tag{8a}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij}=f_h(h_i(h_i,\\{k_j\\})={\\alpha}Ah_i^{(\\alpha-1)}({\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}p(j)dj) \\tag{8b}\n\\]\nand entrepreneur’s wage income is given by (labor earnings plus skill premium)\n\\[\nw_{ij}=f(h_i,\\{k_j\\})-f_k(\\{h_i\\},k_j)\\{k_j\\}=Ah_i^{\\alpha}({\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}p(j)dj)-{(1-\\alpha)}A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)k_j^{1-\\alpha} \\tag {8c}\n\\]\nThe equilibrium outcome of this matching problem depends on assumptions about the choices of capitalists and entrepreneurs in the investment stage. However, the natural equilibrium where capitalists choose the same investment and entrepreneurs choose identical level of skill is not very insightful or different from the Walrasian equilibrium.\n\n3.3.1 The case of uniform distribution of capital and exogenous cost of capital\nConsider the specific case where all capitalists choose the same size of capital, so that \\(k_j=k ̅,\\) but skills vary across entrepreneurs. This scenario is relevant in order to analyze the functioning of capital markets where programs allocate flat amount of capital to entrepreneurs. Although all entrepreneurs receive equal allocation of capital, the amount of capital offered in the market is the level of capital that will be commensurate for the median entrepreneur in the Walrasian market. In this particular case, \\({\\int}k_j^{1-\\alpha}p(j)dj={\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}{\\int}p(j)dj={\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}\\), and the returns to factor inputs are\n\\[\nr_{ij}=f_k(\\{h_i\\},\\bar{k})={(1-\\alpha})A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di){\\bar{k}^{-\\alpha}} \\tag{9a}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij}=f_h(h_i,{\\bar{k}})={\\alpha}Ah_i^{\\alpha-1}\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{9b}\n\\]\nwhile entrepreneur’s total income is given by\n\\[\nw_{ij}={\\alpha}Ah_i^{\\alpha}\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}+({1-\\alpha})A(h_i^{\\alpha}-{\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)\\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\tag{9c}\n\\]\nGiven a required rate of return to capital of μ, the equilibrium condition in the decentralized equilibrium is given by \\(({1-\\alpha})A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di){\\bar{k}^{-\\alpha}}=\\mu\\). The solution to this equation yields the expression:\n\\[\n{\\bar{k}}/h_i=[({1-{\\alpha}})A/\\mu]^{1/{\\alpha}}[({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}]^{1/\\alpha} \\tag{10}\n\\]\nIn comparison with the Walrasian equilibrium, the ratio of capital to skill is no longer constant, but depends on the skill of the individual subscript i and the distribution of skill in the entire market through the ratio \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\). Entrepreneurs with skill higher than the average in the population of entrepreneurs would have capital to skill ratio that is lower than the Walrasian outcome while entrepreneurs with skill lower than the average would have capital to skill ratio that is higher than the Walrasian level, and the capital-skill gap would widen the father the entrepreneur’s skill is away from the average. This is not surprising; it is rather expected from a uniform distribution of capital over a range of skills.\nTo observe how wages are affected by the distribution of skill, (9c) can be re-written as\n\\[\nw_{ij} = \\underbrace{\\alpha A h_i^\\alpha \\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha}}_{Q} + \\underbrace{(1-\\alpha) A h_i^\\alpha \\bar{k}^{1-\\alpha} \\left[1 - \\frac{\\left(\\int h_i^\\alpha p(i) \\, di\\right)}{h_i^\\alpha}\\right]}_{R} \\tag{9c}\n\\]\nwhich is a sum of two parts Q and R. Under the Walrasian auctioneer, entrepreneurs with skill higher than (lower than) the average are matched with capital higher than (lower than) the average so that \\((h_i⋚h ̅⟺k_j⋚k ̅ ).\\) Under the matching rule under consideration here, every entrepreneur is matched with a constant size of capital, leading wage to decrease (increase) in wages for above-average (below-average) workers through Q in equation (9c) relative to the Walrasian outcome in equation (3c). However, there is another effect through the second term. Wages also increase because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i&lt; 1\\) (decreases because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha} &gt;1)\\) through R for entrepreneurs with skills higher than (lower than) the average person. In essence, the net effect of switching from the Walrasian auctioneer to a random matching with uniform distribution of capital on wages depends on the relativity of these changes based on the shape of skill distribution.\nConsider a skill distribution that is skewed to the right. The gap between skill and capital will be large for the highly skilled, thus reducing the value of Q substantially. For the second component R, the value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)h_i\\) will be smaller than one but close to one so that the right hand side contributes little by way of increase. On a net basis, wages will fall for the highly skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. With regards to the low-skill entrepreneur, although Q increases substantially, the increase is more than offset by the large negative value of R induced by a large value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i &gt;1\\), leading to lower wages relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. Thus, wages are lower for both high-skill and low-skill individuals under a random matching and uniform distribution of capital than under the Walrasian allocation.\nIf, on the other hand, skill distribution is sufficiently skewed to the left, the capital-skill gap for the highly skilled entrepreneur is lower relative to the case under the right-skewed distribution but is still larger relative to the Walrasian allocation. So, Q will be lower than under the Walrasian auctioneering outcome. However, the second component will increase significantly because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\) will be small. On a net basis, wages will increase for the skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. For the low-skill entrepreneur, Q will increase substantially relative to the Walrasian allocation and the value of \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}\\) will be close to one so that the right hand side contributes little by way of decrease. On a net basis, wages will also increase for the low-skilled entrepreneur under the uniform distribution of capital relative to the Walrasian equilibrium. Indeed, as noted at the beginning of this subsection, the finding that different shapes of skill distribution yield different wages for the same worker is driven by sensitivity of the (uniform) level of capital to the median level of skill.\nIt is important to characterize this outcome further. The ratio of wage to skill, or the return to (or cost of) skills, obtained by substituting (10) into (9b) yields the following expression:\n\\[\n\\tau_{ij} = \\underbrace{\\left( \\alpha A \\left[ \\left(1-\\alpha\\right) \\frac{A}{\\mu} \\right]^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} \\right)}_{\\tau_W} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\left[ \\frac{\\int h_i^{\\alpha} p(i)di}{h_i^{\\alpha}} \\right]^{\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}} \\right)}_{\\tau_M} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhich is a product of the constant cost of skills under Walrasian allocation (τ_W ) and a multiplier represented by \\((τ_M ).\\) Thus, the cost of skills diverges by level of skill relative to the population average. The first observation from equation (11) is that, regardless of the skill distribution, \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i&gt;1\\) for low-skill entrepreneurs and \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di&lt;1\\) for high-skilled entrepreneurs. Therefore, compared to the Walrasian equilibrium, the cost of skill (re return to skill) is higher for entrepreneurs with skills below the average and lower for entrepreneurs with skills above the population average. In effect, the cost of skills (return to skills) rises for low-skill entrepreneurs and falls for high skill entrepreneurs if we replace the Walrasian equilibrium with the decentralized equilibrium with uniform distribution of capital and random matching. The second observation is that return to skill rises for both high-skilled and low-skilled entrepreneurs as we move from a right-skewed distribution to a left-skewed distribution of skills because \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)\\) increases as a result. In effect, return to skills rises for everyone as the average level of skill rises in the population. When the two factors are combined, the low-skilled entrepreneurs benefit more in terms of return to skill under a left-skewed distribution than a right skewed distribution. This captures a form of social returns to skill that has been emphasized by Acemoglu (1996) – see page 787 of the article.\nWhy are wages higher under uniform distribution of capital compared to the Walrasian efficient allocation rule when skill distribution is left-skewed but lower when skill distribution is right-skewed? Given that the cost of capital is exogenous, there are two explanatory factors. One, the amount of capital supplied to the market rises with the median level of skill, so that capital per entrepreneur is higher under the left-skewed skill distribution than under the right-skewed distribution. “As the cost of education falls for a group of workers, the stock of skill in the economy increases, and firms want to increase their capital (p.787)” Thus, low-skill entrepreneurs benefit in terms of higher levels of capital induced by the high level of median skill when skill distribution is left-skewed than they would be allocated under the Walrasian rule. Second, a right-skewed skill distribution yields little for the low-skill entrepreneur in terms of capital increase with the change of rule, and any such benefit from capital is outweighed by the decrease in returns to skill, leading to lower wages. For high-skilled entrepreneurs, reduction in return to skills associated with the right-skewed distribution is reinforced by large reduction in capital.\nProposition 3\n\nSuppose the matching technology allocates capital uniformly to entrepreneurs, \\(k_j=k ̅(h ̈ ),\\) where \\(h ̈∈ {(h^L,h^H)}\\) is the level of skill chosen by entrepreneurs.\nThe equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^H\\) where capital to skill ratio is given by equation (10) is efficient and wages given by equation (9c) is preferred to the Walrasian equilibrium described by equation (6) and equation (4).\nThe equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^L\\) where capital to skill ratio is given by equation (10) is inefficient and wages given byequation (9c) is worse than the Walrasian equilibrium described by (7f).\n\nThe foregoing implies that when the stock of capital is flexible under random matching with uniform distribution of capital so that average capital increases with average (median) level of skill, entrepreneurs earn higher wages when the population of entrepreneurs is high-skilled on average and lower wages when the population is low-skilled. This scenario leads to multiple equilibria where wages are lower than the Walrasian equilibrium in the equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^L\\)and are higher in the equilibrium with \\(h ̈=h^H\\) whereas the cost of capital, capital-skill ratio and cost of skill are constant and the same as the Walrasian equilibrium."

    "text": "3.4 Decentralized equilibrium with endogenous cost of capital\nWe discard the assumption of uniform distribution of capital and consider the case where matching is random (large number of lenders and borrowers) and the required rate of return on capital is a decreasing function of entrepreneur’s skill. That is, \\(μ=μ(h_i ).\\) For simplicity, we assume that \\(μ=θ⁄h_i\\) . Solving \\(({1-\\alpha}A({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)p(i)di)k_j^{-\\alpha}={\\theta}/h_i\\) yields\n\\[\n\\frac{k_j}{h_i} = \\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha) A}{\\theta}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} \\left(\\frac{\\left(\\int h_i^{\\alpha} p(i) \\, di\\right)}{(h_i^{\\alpha}) \\cdot h_i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}} \\tag{12}\n\\]\nIn this case, the capital to skill ratio is determined by the entrepreneur’s both relative and absolute levels of skill. A high-skill entrepreneur in a population with high average level of skill will have very high capital to skill ratio relative to the Walrasian outcome, while a low-skill entrepreneur in a population of entrepreneurs with low average skill will have very low capital to skill ratio relative to the Walrasian rule. In the former, the high average skill will attract high levels of capital that are typically cheaper to administer, and the entrepreneur’s high skill will further reduce the cost of capital thereby enabling him to demand large size of capital. In the latter case, the low average skill attracts low level of capital, which is typically more costly. The entrepreneur’s own low skill level further raises the cost, ensuring that his demand for capital will be low. Otherwise, a high-skill entrepreneur in a population with low average skill and a low-skill entrepreneur in a population with high average skill may have similar ratios of capital to skill. The capital-skill ratio will be the most dispersed among the matching rules considered so far. Because larger sizes of loan are typically less expensive to administer in reality relative to small loans, this is likely to mirror the system in well-developed credit markets. An analysis of equation (12) shows that the allocation is characterized by an indefinite number of equilibria. Suppose, instead, that such unique equilibrium level of skill exists. From equation (12), although \\(({\\int}h_i^{\\alpha}p(i)di)/h_i^{\\alpha}=1\\), the resulting capital skill ratio which simplifies to \\(k_j/h_i=[{(1-\\alpha)}A/\\theta]^{1/{\\alpha}}\\) depends on the level of skill. Because this is not the same for everyone who chooses the same level of skill, then there is no unique equilibrium. The problem could be modified if the cost of capital is a step function. In that case, there could be up to twice as many equilibria as the number of steps once we incorporate skill distribution. It is possible that the standard credit market has a matching technology that generates a finite number of equilibria, each with unique realization of wages and constant capital-skills ratio."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nAlthough many factors have been advanced for expansion of self-employment, the government initiatives were undoubtedly central. In order to combat high unemployment that persisted into the late 1970s, the British government under Margaret Thatcher created several initiatives aimed at supporting self-employment beginning from 1981. These initiatives include the Enterprise Allowance Scheme which provided guaranteed income of GBP40 per week to unemployed people that set up an enterprise, the Loan Guarantee Scheme through which the government provided the security that lenders usually require in order to facilitate lending to viable small businesses that may lack access to finance, and the Business Expansion Scheme that aimed to provide investment opportunities for investors.↩︎\nThese efforts came in many forms. There were pressures on lending institutions to reduce interest rates, leading to development of enterprise finance initiatives by commercial banks and other financial institutions. Some assistance also came in the form of credit guarantees. These efforts drew a large number among the unemployed workers into entrepreneurship.↩︎\nGovernments in Africa and other developing countries implemented low-cost capital schemes during 1970s and early 1980 and the outcomes were self-defeating. Earnings plunged, default rates rose and poverty rates arising from very low wages skyrocketed. The self-defeating growth of higher employment and lower wages following increased supply of low-cost capital could be attributed to several factors. First, an exogenous decrease in the cost of capital will result in lower average skills and therefore reduce enterprise productivity. Output produced by low-tech enterprises is typically non-tradable and only subject to demand for domestic consumption. In countries where imported goods are favored over domestic products due to either preferences or quality issues, low-tech enterprise output growth is associated with product glut and low prices. Second, other than capital requirement, there is free-entry into the sector and low-tech production systems can easily be replicated. Free entry ensures that output prices and therefore earnings are driven to razor-thin competitive levels. The absence of institutional barriers and coordination failures make price regulations impossible. Third, an increased supply of capital that is not driven by skills will have different implications than supply shift that is driven by skills. Increased supply of capital that is driven by skill upgrade moves the enterprise sector toward more productive enterprises and leads to higher wages. On the other hand, an increase in the supply of capital without efficient matching leads to lower wages and reduction in enterprise efficiency levels.↩︎\nExpectation of positive selection on ability into wage employment in non-competitive labor markets is based on the assumption that individuals with high ability are likely to be selected by employers. In non-clearing markets, employers subject job candidates to series of tests -- written, oral and situation-room types of experiences -- in order to select the most able candidates. Because these opportunities are limited, individuals with the highest abilities are often drawn into wage employment at least for the first few years of their careers. However, the sample of workers who seek wage employment may not be representative of the labor force. Indeed, if individuals with the highest levels of ability choose not to seek wage employment, then positive selection on ability into wage employment among job-seekers will not translate into positive selection on ability for the entire labor force.↩︎\nThe deficit of attention to skill and capital matching is not surprising. It is always assumed, and taken for granted, that the credit market is capable of creating efficient matches between capital and skill in the formation of enterprises. But there are noteworthy grounds to believe that this is not always the case. The practice in the credit market to screen borrowers on the basis of perception of information asymmetry rather than on the basis of borrowers’ productivity implies that high productivity individuals lacking collateral may be denied access to entrepreneurship capital.↩︎\nSoderbom (2011) concludes that large firms use more productive technologies than small firms and Sandefur (2010) shows that capital per worker increases by firm size in the Ghanaian data, equivalent to capital increasing by size of enterprise in the case of one-person enterprise.↩︎\nThis is consistent with the practice where the profits of the enterprise are considered as earnings of the entrepreneur. The only difference is that we separate returns to labor from returns to skill in the model.↩︎"

    "section": "1.1 Background of the study",
    "text": "1.1 Background of the study\nNigeria is the most populous country in Africa and ranks number 7 in the list of world countries by population with a current population of about 196 million, based on the latest United Nations estimate, which also accounts for about 2.57% of the entire world’s population (World Population Review, 2018). The rural areas constitute about 51.40% of the population while the rest of the population is urban. The rural communities play a significant role in the development of the country. It has been noted that the major source of income for rural dwellers include primary economic activities such as agriculture which plays a major role in Nigeria’s economic development Abah (2010). Agriculture accounts for one-third of the country’s Gross Domestic product (GDP) and employs two-third of the labor force Bola (2007). The rural communities, of which about 90% are involved in agriculture, are a principal source of capital for the country, are major providers of raw materials for the country’s industrial processes Nyagba (2009) and are the major providers of food in the country IFAD (2014). The country’s population is constantly on the rise with a population growth rate of 2.61%. Nigeria is also estimated to have a population of over 230million by 2025 and to rank third most populous country in the world by 2050 (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2017). This rising population growth puts the resources of the country under tremendous pressure. This rapid population growth is majorly accounted for by high total fertility rate National Population Commission and ICF International (2014). A survey carried out among the developing countries, revealed that total fertility rate was highest in the Sub– Saharan Africa at an average of 5.3 children per woman Olalekan et al. (2011) Also, statistics showed that Total Fertility Rate, TFR, or the average number of children per woman over the course of her lifetime, declined from 6.5 in 1990 to 5.7 in 2008 in Nigeria. Currently the TFR of an average Nigerian woman is 5.5 births per woman, the TFR of women in the rural areas is 6.3 while that of women in the urban areas is 4.8 National Population Commission (2013). This TFR implies that an average Nigerian woman, at the end of her childbearing age, would have given birth to about 6 children. Birth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. It is defined as “the use of various devices, drugs, agents, sexual practices, or surgical procedures to prevent conception or pregnancy” (Nordqvist, 2009). Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century Hanson and Burke (n.d.). Around the world, more women are using various birth control methods, but the figure is still low in developing countries, Mazumder et al. (2001) especially in Africa. In Nigeria specifically, just about 15% of the men and women who were reported to know about contraception methods actually use them. The low rate of contraceptive use in Nigeria results in high fertility rates, particularly in the rural areas. This high fertility rate accounts for Nigeria’s high maternal, infant, and neonatal mortalities. There has only been a slight increase in contraceptive prevalence and only a slight reduction in fertility rates in the country National Population Commission (2013). Hence, contraceptive practice remains low and fertility, population growth and unmet need for family planning are high.\nThe rate of population growth is also a cause for concern as population explosions poses major health and economic challenges to the nation. Households with many children are more likely, over time, to become poor and less likely to recover from poverty than families with only a few children (Ajakaiye and Adeyeye (2001); Orbeta (2005) ). Unfortunately, there are very few studies that assess how the use of birth control methods affect household wellbeing in Nigeria. Against this background, this study sought to answer the following research questions: i. What is the fertility rate over time among rural households? ii. What is the wellbeing status of rural households? iii. How does the use of birth control methods affect the fertility? And, iv. How does fertility of rural households affect their wellbeing?"

    "section": "2.1 Theoretical Framework",
    "text": "2.1 Theoretical Framework\nFertility theories seek to describe the major influences affecting fertility and no theory is capable of explaining fertility behavior in all societies throughout time. There are macrolevel theories and also microeconomic theories. The macrolevel theories include Malthus population theory and the microeconomic theories include Becker’s theory and this study is based on these two theories.\n\n2.1.1 Malthus Population Theory\nMalthusian population theory was developed due to rapid population growth rate and low returns from agriculture. Malthus in his essay assumed that man’s ability to reproduce was greater than his ability to produce Malthus (1826). Malthus analysis was based on the proposition that man’s capacity to increase his means of subsistence was much less than his capacity to multiply. He stated in his essay “Population when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in arithmetical ratio” Malthus (1826). Furthermore, Malthus believed that if an increasing population growth was left unchecked, a time will come when population would exceed food availability. Malthus proposed two types of checks- the preventive check and the positive check. The main preventive check refers to moral restraints and postponement of marriage which are considered to reduce birth rate. He also proposed the use of birth control as part of the preventive checks. Malthus also believed that every individual must be conscious of the fact that his welfare lies in limiting the size of his family.\n\n\n2.1.2 Economic Theory of Fertility\nThis theory was out forth by the American economist, Gary Becker in 1960. According to Becker, families lacking knowledge of birth control could exercise control over their births through abortion or abstinence in the form of delayed marriage and reduced frequency of coition during marriage. This gave very little room for decision making given the taboos against abortion, the strong social forces determining the age of marriage, and the relative inefficiency of reductions in the frequency of coition. Hence, births among families would be largely determined by chance. However, the growth in knowledge of birth control increases the chances of decision making by families.\nIn Becker’s terms, children may be considered as both consumption goods, as they are a source of psychic income and satisfaction to their parents, as well as production goods, as they may sometimes provide money income. The benefits they yield are not fixed but vary in amount with the child’s age, making children a durable consumption and production good. However, this classification does not imply that the satisfactions or costs associated with children are the same as those associated with other durables. According to Becker’s analysis, a family must not only determine the number of children to have, but also determine the amount spent on them. In his work, he referred to more expensive children as “higher quality” children. Also, Becker assumed that an increase in income would lead to an increase in the amount spent on children, most of which would increase the quality of the children.\nConclusively, Malthus, on the other hand, concluded that an increase in income would lead to a large increase in family size due to 2 major reasons. First, according to Malthus, an increase in income would cause a decline in child mortality, enabling more children to survive childhood. Second, he argued that increase in income increases fertility by inducing people to marry earlier and ’abstain less while married. However, Becker’s analysis generalized that of Malthus and concluded that quantity elasticity is probably positive but small in modern societies for 2 reasons. First, a decline in child mortality would induce a corresponding decline in births because parents are interested in the number of survivors and not in the number of births. Also, because births can now be controlled without abstinence, it is no longer guaranteed that an increase in income would result in a large increase in fertility."

    "text": "2.2 Conceptual Clarifications: Birth Control, Fertility and Wellbeing\n\n2.2.1 Birth Control Methods\nBirth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. More specifically, it is defined as “the use of various devices, drugs, agents, sexual practices, or surgical procedures to prevent conception or pregnancy” (Nordqvist, 2009). Several methods have been used to control birth since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century Hanson and Burke (n.d.). Planning, making available, and using birth control is referred to as family planning. More specifically, family planning services refers to activities that enable individuals to determine the number and spacing of their children. It involves the use of contraception and other techniques to control the timing of reproduction. The term is sometimes used to refer to access to and use of contraception. Both terms are sometimes used interchangeably in several literature. In Nigeria, just as around the world, several practiced were used to control conception. These practices can generally be referred to as traditional methods of birth control. These traditional methods are basically fertility awareness- based methods. Here, a woman is expected to understand her menstrual cycle, to know the periods where she is safe and when she’s unsafe, i.e, ovulation or fertile periods, and avoid sexual intercourse during unsafe periods. These methods include:\n\nRhythm Method\n\nThis method predicts when ovulation will occur based on when it occurred in past cycles. It is practicable in women with relatively regular menstrual cycles. In this method, women avoid sexual intercourse 3 days to her estimated ovulation date, which is usually 14 days to her expected period date, up to 3 days after, making a total of 7 days.\n\nCervical Secretions\n\nThis method involves watching changes in the cervical mucus. Normal vaginal discharge changes at the time of ovulation. At this time, there is more mucus, it feels wet and slippery, looks like egg white and can be stretched between the fingers. After ovulation, there is less mucus and it is sticky or even dry, blocking sperm from entering the uterus. This signifies a safe period.\n\nBasal Body Temperature Method\n\nThis involves taking daily temperature readings to detect when ovulation is occurring. It is based on the principle that during ovulation, progesterone increases your body temperature by 0.2 - 0.5°C. Sex is avoided on days when the temperature in increased and can be resumed when the temperature goes back to the baseline and remains so for 3 days.\n\nSympto-thermal Methods\n\nThis method involves the combination of various methods that indicate ovulation periods. It involves a combination of at least 2 of the above methods and other symptoms such as breast tenderness, slight lower abdominal pain, abdominal heaviness and slight bleeding/spotting. This method is more effective than using only one of the above-mentioned methods.\n\nWithdrawal Method\n\nThis is the oldest method known and is also referred to as “coitus interruptus”. Coitus unterruptus refers to the withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before the release of ejaculate. This means that ejaculation must take place outside of the vagina. No other protection methods are usually used with the withdrawal method. This method is associated with high failure rates because it requires a strong degree of motivation on the part of the male. Also, the pre-ejaculatory secretions can contain millions of spermatozoa that can cause pregnancy. Nonetheless, the method is the most commonly used birth control method among Nigerian males.\n\nLactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)\n\nThis is a temporary birth control method that depends on exclusive breastfeeding from birth up to 6 months after birth. This method is based on the physiological concept that breast feeding women have amenorrhea and are therefore not ovulating. However, for the method to be successful, the baby must fully be on breast milk and periods should not have started. It can only be regarded as a temporary form of contraception as chances of periods starting increase after 6 months, hence the failure rate is very low in the first 6 months.\nThe modern birth controls methods available are profiled below.\n\nPhysical Barrier Methods\n\nBarrier contraceptives are those that prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering into the uterus Lawrence (2008). They include, male condoms, female condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms and contraceptive sponges. Globally, condoms are the most common birth control methods Chaudhuri (2007) According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), the condom is reported to be the main contraceptive method known of and used by Nigerian women of reproductive age.\n\nHormonal Contraception\n\nThese are contraceptives that use hormones to prevent pregnancy. Hormonal contraception is available in different forms which include oral pills, implants and injections and they are currently available only for women.\nThere are 2 types of oral birth control pills, the combined oral contraceptive pills (which contain both estrogen and a progestin) and the progestogen-only pills, sometimes called minipills Ammer (2009). Both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucus. They may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation Hoffman (2011). The pills are 92% effective. The Depo Provera injection is another form of hormonal contraceptive. Commonly referred to as the injection, it is a contraceptive injection containing progestogen. It prevents pregnancy by stopping the ovaries releasing an egg each month and there are also changes to the lining of the womb. The levonorgestrel subdermal implant (Norplant) is the most commonly available long-acting progestin-only subdermal implant in Nigeria. It has been found to be highly effective and safe and generally acceptable to Nigerian women.\n\nIntrauterine Devices\n\nThe current intrauterine devices (IUD) are small devices, often ‘T’-shaped, containing either copper or levonorgestrel, which are inserted into the uterus. The hormones or the Cooper stops the sperm from reaching the egg. Even when sperm does reach the egg, the IUD stops the egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus. They are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control Winner et al. (2012), they are 99% effective. The IUD is very popular and widely used in Nigeria, particularly by older married women.\n\nSterilization\n\nSterilization, is also known as permanent contraception. It prevents all future pregnancies and is very difficult and impossible to reverse. Surgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men. Tubal ligation is a procedure to cut or clip a woman’s fallopian tubes so that sperm cannot get an egg to fertilize. Although this method is commonly used worldwide, especially in developed countries and in some developing countries in Asia and South America, it is not a common or acceptable contraceptive choice in Nigeria. This may be due to high cost of the procedure, scarcity of skilled providers (especially in rural areas), and fear of surgical complications (G. 2007).\nVasectomy refers to permanent male sterilization. The male tubes are cut and tied to prevent sperm from mixing with the semen and hence prevent fertilization. Although the procedure is simple, safe, and effective, it is not readily accepted as a method of fertility control in Nigeria (Akinwuntan and Shittu 2008).\n\nEmergency Contraception\n\nEmergency contraceptive methods are medications or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hopes of preventing pregnancy. They work by delaying the female body from releasing an egg or by preventing the sperm from fertilizing an egg. However, it does not work once an egg has been fertilized. A number of options exist, including high dose birth control pills, levonorgestrel, mifepristone and IUDs. These methods are very effective.\n\n\n2.2.2 Birth Control and Fertility\nFertility refers to natural capability to produce offspring. It can also be said to be the actual production of offspring rather than the physical ability to produce offspring, which is termed “fecundity”. Fertility rate as a measure of fertility, refers to the number of offspring produced per individual or population. It is the relative frequency with which births actually occur in a given population Ushie (2009). In demographic contexts, fertility is measured in a variety of ways generally classified as period measures or cohort measures. Period measures refer to a cross-section of the population in one year while cohort measures follow the same people over a period of decades. Both period and cohort measures are widely used Demeny and McNicoll (2003). The period measures include crude birth rate (CBR), General fertility rate (GFR) and Child-woman ratio (CWR) while the cohort measures include total fertility rate (TFR), gross reproduction rate (GRR) and net reproduction rate (NRR). According to Ushie (2009), fertility is a function of two basic variables which are biological and individual choices. The biological function is influenced by genetics while the individual choices are influenced by sociocultural and economic conditions Demeny and McNicoll (2003) . The main measure of fertility used by this study is the total children ever born. The total fertility rate, TFR, refers to the average number of children a woman would have at the end of her reproductive age, or over the course of her lifetime. Total Fertility Rates (TFR) are higher in Sub-Saharan African countries than in other major regions of the world. The TFR of sub-Saharan Africa was 5.1 births per woman, as at 2010, which is double the rate in other regions - 2.3 births per woman in Asia and Latin America (“United Nations,” n.d.).\n\n\n2.2.3 Birth Control and Wellbeing\nAs earlier stated, wellbeing may be described as the quality of life of an individual. Several studies have also described wellbeing as the set of human activities that describe the conditions of life that an individual experience (Adeoti and Akinwande (2013); Rojas (2004) ). Also, wellbeing has been recognized to include issues of health, education, security, freedom, social relations and others and not just income and consumption Oladokun, Adenegan, and Alawode (2017). It represents various aspects of personal and family satisfaction in life such as the feelings of being prosperous or happy; health and nutrition; material wealth; and education. Wellbeing status of rural households is also said to be lower than that of the urban population due to several factors such as inadequate social amenities, agriculture as the main occupation and generally low standards of living, among others. Previous studies have found that use of birth control methods does not only affect fertility, but it also affects wellbeing in general. Low levels of wellbeing have been attributed to high rates of population growth which limits the amount of resources available to an individual, resulting from the high fertility rate which is also due to low levels of birth control use (see; Canning and Schultz (2012), Cleland et al. (2012) )."

    "section": "2.3 REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES",
    "text": "2.3 REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES\nIt is believed that a fertility decline as a result of birth control use is associated with reduced mortality, hence enhancing human capital formation. It has been previously established in this study that the rate of maternal mortality was high in Nigeria World Health Organization (2014) resulting from high fertility, therefore a reduction in fertility would mean a reduction in mortality (Schultz, 2007). This corresponds to the findings of other studies which also concluded that use of birth control helped to reduce the number of pregnancies and improve birth spacing which reduced maternal mortality (Cleland et al. (2012); Rutstein (2005); Conde-Agudelo and Belizan (2000); Osemwhenka, 2004). It was also discovered that women who never used birth control were about 3 times more likely to be undernourished than their counterparts Adebowale, Fagbamigbe, and Bamgboye (2011) . Body Mass Index (BMI) was considered a key variable in the research between nutrition and fertility and it is assumed to have an inverse relationship with fertility (Hosseini-Chavoshi et al., 2008). The study found that a significant difference existed between the mean BMI for those who used and those who never used birth control. Other studies have shown that a woman with higher BMI is likely to return to fertility sooner than her counterpart with lower BMI (Popkin et al. (1994); Adebowale, Fagbamigbe, and Bamgboye (2011) ). Furthermore, it was discovered that apart from improvements in health, use of birth control improved the wellbeing of families in other areas. Canning and Schultz (2012) proposed that the use of birth control had certain economic repercussions for the family. For instance, fewer or adequately spaced pregnancies gave women the opportunity to acquire more skills and trainings that would increase their earning capacities, parents would also be able to acquire more physical assets (Becker and Lewis (1974); T. Paul Schultz (2008) ). This is consistent with the findings of Bailey (2006), who also found that early access to birth control in the US increased women’s investment in their careers, hence increasing their wages. A study carried out in Matlab, Bangladesh discovered that women who used birth control methods were reported to have more physical assets in their households than those who did not use any methods. These assets moved away from livestock and tended towards housing and financial assets, consumer durables and jewelry T. Paul Schultz (2009). Women in these households were also found to earn about 40% higher income than their counterparts. However, a similar study in Madagascar found no significant relationship between birth control use and household income Hajason, Piña, and Raveloharimisy (2013). It was also found that as a result of reducing their fertility, parents can then increase their transfers to each child in form of gifts as well as human capital (Becker, 1981; Quisumbing and Maluccio, 2003). As a result, parents can invest more in each child in terms of nutrition, health and education. A similar study however, found a weak relationship between birth control use and child’s schooling Hajason, Piña, and Raveloharimisy (2013). Kraudal (2000), suggested that fertility rates will reduce with an increase in women’s education. He also opined that the net effect of community education outweighs that of individual education. Hence the more the proportion of better educated women in a society, the lower the fertility rates in that society. Studies have shown a strong positive relationship between wealth status and use of birth control to reduce fertility (Kishor & Lekha, 2008; Elfstrom & Stephenson, 2012). Few studies in Nigeria have found a direct relationship between birth control use and wealth index (Adebowale, Fagbamigbe, and Bamgboye (2011); Odusina, Ugai, and Olaposi (2012) ). They found that women in the richer wealth index or higher socioeconomic status were more likely to use birth control than their counterparts. This finding is similar to the findings of an earlier study which took place in Bangladesh which found that women who belonged to groups that received microfinance support were more empowered and more prone to contraceptive use than their counterparts who did not receive that support (Schuler & Hashemi, 1994). Whereas, quantitative measures of a similar study in Ghana found that receiving microfinance support did not influence women’s use of birth control (Norwood, 2005). Adeyemo and Oni (2012) discovered that large household size increased wellbeing of rural households. They implied that this may be due to the fact that rural households depend on family labor for their agrarian activities, hence large family size leads to increased productivity thereby leading to increased income and wellbeing. The study also found that increased educational levels and being in formal occupations significantly increased wellbeing status."

The framework starts by showing socio-economic factors that influence the use of birth control methods. The use of birth control then directly affects fertility shown by the TFR, birth rates and number of living children. Use of birth control also directly affects the wellbeing status of households through its direct influence on their health, economic status, and so on, and indirectly affects wellbeing through its effects on fertility.\n\n\n\nConceptual Framework"

    "text": "3.1 Scope of the study\nThis study focused on the rural population of Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the Sub-Saharan nations located in the western part of Africa. Nigeria is widely recognized as the most populous country in Africa and the country has 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory. The rural areas refer to those areas in the country characterized by fewer homes or buildings and lower population density compared to the urban areas, or by certain socioeconomic features. The rural population constitutes about 51.40% of the entire country’s population, which means that more than half of the population of Nigeria resides in the rural areas. Rural Nigeria is characterized by agrarian livelihood as well as certain other primary production activities."

The study used cross-sectional dataset collected from the National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) for the years 2008 and 2013. The NDHS is a survey that is designed to provide data to monitor the population and health situation in Nigeria. The surveys gathered information on demographics, as well as fertility levels, fertility preferences, marriage, awareness and use of family planning methods, nutritional status of women and children, mortality, and so on. In addition to presenting national estimates, the reports provided estimates of key indicators for both the rural and urban areas in Nigeria. The target groups were women aged 15-49 in randomly selected households across Nigeria."

Descriptive analyses of mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum value and frequency table was used to describe the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents, includes: their age, sex, household size, marital status, region of residence, occupation, religion, wealth index and educational level. The fertility rate was measured using the total number of children ever born as the main variable while wellbeing was measured by the womens’ BMI.\nOrdinary least squares method was used to determine the effect of the use of birth control on the fertility rate of rural households and the effect of fertility on their wellbeing. Ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: (minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being predicted) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.

The distribution reveals that 34.9 percent of rural Nigerian women in 2008 and 36.5 percent in 2013, had between 3 and 5 children as at the time the data was collected. The table also revealed that 68.6 percent of the women had 5 children or less in 2008 which increased to 71.2 percent in 2013. The minimum number of a children to a woman is 0 and the maximum number is 18 children. In 2008, the average number of children to a rural Nigerian woman is 4.25 with a standard deviation of 3.01 and this decreases only slightly to 4.07 in 2013 with a standard deviation of 2.87. This slight reduction in the average number of children born to a Nigerian woman in the rural areas may be attributed to the slight increase in the use of birth control.

BMI is a relative weight measure and has been observed to have correlations with health, income, employment and promotion (Hubler, 2019).\nWellbeing of rural women by BMI\nThis study used body mass index (BMI) as the main indicator for the health and wellbeing of rural women. Table 16 shows that most of the rural women in Nigeria have normal weight, with a percentage of 67.9 and 62.1 percent in 2008 and 2013 respectively. This shows that a lot of rural women have normal health and wellbeing. The table also shows an increase in the percentage of women that are overweight, from 14.6 percent in 2008 to 20.5 percent in 2013 as well as increasing obesity from 4.2 percent in 2008 to 9.1 percent in 2013. Previous studies have already shown that Sub-Saharan Africa is an experiencing an increase in overweight and obesity, even though the region is still dealing with under-nutrition Black et al. (2008), which is influenced by physical inactivity and dietary patterns.

    "text": "4.5 Assessing the Effect of Birth Control on Fertility\nThis section attempts to explain the effect of the use of birth control methods on fertility of rural women in Nigeria. The result of the linear regression is shown in table 17 and it identifies demographic factors that could affect fertility such as age, region, level of education, wealth index, marital status and occupation of the women, as well as the use of birth control method. The analysis found the north east, north west and south south regions, involvement in sales, agriculture, and manual labour as factors that positively affect fertility. That is, they increase fertility. Other factors that were found to negatively affect fertility include secondary and higher education, wealth index, south west region and use of birth control methods. The results also showed that fertility reduced with time in 2013.\nAge of Respondent\nTable 17 showed the age of women to be a significant factor which may affect fertility. The positive coefficient implies that fertility of women increases with increasing age.\nMarital Status\nTable 17 showed that a woman’s marital status was significantly related to her fertility level. The negative coefficients imply that a woman who is divorced, widowed or separated is expected to have lower fertility levels when compared to her married counterparts. This is in line with the result of other related studies which found that women who were currently legally married were more likely to have higher fertility than women who were not in any union (Alene and Worku (2008); Fagbamigbe et al. (2014)) or women who were only living together with their partner Akpa and Ikpotokin (2012). Couples who are legally married and are living together should have higher coital frequency, hence increasing fertility levels.\nUse of Birth Control Methods\nThe result of the analysis in table 17 showed that the use of birth control significantly affects fertility levels. The use of birth control was found to be negatively related to fertility level, that is, fertility or number of children born reduces with the use of birth control methods. It has been previously established that the use of birth control is a means of curbing high fertility and this is consistent with the findings of other studies which revealed that couples use one or more birth control methods to limit or space their children (Ijaiya et al. (2009); Adebowale, Fagbamigbe, and Bamgboye (2011) ). This is in a bid to curb the current population explosion and for several other reasons which could be economic, social or medical.\nEducational Level\nThe result in table 17 found secondary and higher education to be significantly related to fertility and the regression coefficients were negative, implying a negative relationship between level of education and fertility. This implies that fertility reduces as level of education increases. This finding corroborates with previous studies which also found a significant negative effect of education on fertility (Osili and Long (2008) ; Fagbamigbe et al. (2014); Mberu and Reed (2014) ). These studies indicate that women with no formal education or primary education had higher fertility (about 1.5 children per woman higher) than those with secondary or higher education. Barber et al. (2002) explained that fertility reduces with higher educational levels because the women would have spent longer period of childbearing years in school when compared to their counterparts. Carr, Pan, and Bilsborrow (2006) also explained that higher levels of education may improve a woman’s knowledge of information regarding fertility options. Education also gives women opportunities to participate in the labor force.\nOccupation\nThe result in table 17 revealed that some groups of occupation were statistically significant in relation to fertility level. These include women in the professional/technical/managerial field, women involved in sales, agriculture, services and skilled manual labor. While being involved in a professional field was negatively related to fertility levels, all other occupational groups showed a positive relationship to fertility. This corroborates the findings of other studies which found that increased participation of a woman in labor force reduces her fertility levels El-Ghannam (2005). A woman in the professional field is more educated than the average rural woman, hence she is likely to have lower fertility levels than others. On the other hand, a woman’s involvement in agriculture, increases the likelihood of having more children because it is believed that more children translate to more help with the farming activities.\nWealth index\nThe wealth index of the women was also found to be statistically significant to fertility with negative coefficients, implying that fertility reduces with increasing wealth status. Women in the middle and rich categories are more likely to use birth control methods, hence lowering their fertility. This result supports the findings of previous studies which also revealed that poorer women were more likely to have higher fertility levels than their counterparts (Adebowale, Fagbamigbe, and Bamgboye (2011); Fagbamigbe et al. (2014); Akpa and Ikpotokin (2012) ).\nRegion\nTable 17 revealed that the all the regions, except the south east region, were significantly related to fertility. The north east, north west and south south regions were shown to positively affect fertility. This implies that the women in these regions were more likely to have more children than women than in the south west region. This study supports the findings of previous studies which found that the north east and north west zones (predominantly populated by Muslims and Hausa, Fulani and Kanuri ethnic groups) have the higher fertility rates in the compared with other regions Mberu and Reed (2014) with TFR of 6.3 and 6.7 respectively which is 2 children higher than that of women in the southern zones (National Population Commission and ICF Macro (2009) ; National Population Commission and ICF International (2014) ). Another study implemented in the northern zones found that fertility is a key socio-political, cultural and economic resource in the region. The study identified several factors that contribute to high fertility levels in the region, such as the Koranic inheritance doctrine that promotes childbearing and polygamy and the depiction of contraceptives as against Islamic doctrine Izugabara et al. (2009) . General lack of comprehensive information of birth control and unavailability of birth control in the region have also been found to cause high fertility in the region (Smith (2004) ; McNicoll (2011) ). This study also found the regression coefficient for the south west region was negative and significant. This supports the finding of previous study that found that the south west region has the lowest fertility levels (Mberu and Reed 2014).\n\n\n\nEffect of birth control use on fertilityVariablesCoefficientStandard.Errort..valueAge of respondent0.2268***0.0014000165.67Age of household head  -0.00150.0009000-1.61Marital statusLiving with partner  -0.2403***0.0630000-3.81Widowed     -0.8839***0.0555000-15.92Divorced  -1.2841***0.0842000-15.26No longer living together/separated  -1.0468***0.0829000-12.63Use of Birth Control Methods-0.0507*0.0306880-1.65Educational levelPrimary-0.00050.0281000-0.02Secondary-0.5975***0.0319000-18.71Higher -0.5028***0.0553000-27.17OccupationProfessional/technical/managerial  -0.1697***0.0611000-2.78Clerical     0.09260.15800000.59Sales  0.3478***0.025500013.62Agricultural self-employed  0.3939***0.12550003.14Agricultural - employee  0.2483***0.03200007.76Household and domestic  -0.39560.2913000-1.36Services  0.0941*0.05400001.74Skilled manual  0.1857***0.03600005.16Unskilled manual  0.51730.32270001.60Wealth indexmiddle  -0.0901***0.0274000-3.29rich  -0.4498***0.0306000-14.68RegionNorth East 0.5974***0.033341217.92  North West 0.6554***0.032836519.96  South East -0.00050.0410943-0.01South South0.0903**0.03760072.40South west-0.4273***0.0377885-11.31Time2013-0.0728***0.0207164-3.51Constant-2.932-2.9321000-58.69Author’s computation, 2019"

    "text": "4.6 Assessing the Effect of Fertility on Wellbeing\nThis section aims to assess the effect of fertility on wellbeing of rural women. The result of the regression analysis carried out is presented in table 18. This result identifies factors that could influence wellbeing which include region of residence, occupation, household size, educational level, wealth index, marital status, total number of children ever born, occupation and use of birth control methods. The result shows that factors such as region, educational level, wealth index, total children ever born, some groups of occupation and marital status were found to be significantly related to wellbeing while others such as household size, age of household head and use of birth control methods were not significantly related to wellbeing. Age, educational level, wealth index and use of birth control were found to be positively related to wellbeing while the other factors showed a negative relationship. It was also found that wellbeing of the women in rural Nigeria has improved over time.\nAge\nTable 18 revealed that women’s age was significantly related to their wellbeing levels. The coefficient of age indicated a positive relationship between age and wellbeing. This implies that women’s wellbeing increases as they grow older. This means that as women become older, they have better understanding and experience in issues regarding health and wellbeing and can manage these issues better than younger women with little experience. This finding is consistent with that of previous studies (Adeyemo and Oni (2012) ; Udensi, Ifenkwe, and Ashiegbu (2015) ).\nMarital status\nThe result in table 18 shows that some stars groups were statistically significant in explaining wellbeing while the others were not. Being divorced or separated are not significantly related to wellbeing, although negative. On the other hand, living with partner and widowed are significantly related but their coefficients are also negative. This means that women in these groups are likely to have reduced wellbeing levels. For widowed women, it may be due to the unexpected loss of the breadwinner of the family. This result also showed that level of wellbeing reduces with being in an informal union. This finding supports that of previous studies (Adeyemo and Oni 2012).\nHousehold size\nThe result in table 18 from the analysis showed that the household size was not significant to the level of wellbeing of the woman, however, it showed a negative coefficient. This implies that as household size increases, wellbeing level reduces. That is, the larger the number of household members, the more difficult it is to manage the affairs of the household and the more stress is exerted on the woman. Although insignificant, the negative result supports the findings of other studies ( Ukoha, Mejeha, and Ite (2007); Udensi, Ifenkwe, and Ashiegbu (2015) ).\nEducational level\nThe educational level of the woman was found to be significantly related to her wellbeing. Table 18 revealed that primary, secondary and higher education were all significant at 1%. The coefficients show a positive relationship between education and wellbeing. This implies that the more educated a woman is, the better her wellbeing. That is, the level of wellbeing increases with increase in educational level. Education exposes the women to better ways of managing resources and generally improves their decision-making abilities regarding nutrition, health and wellbeing in general. This finding is consistent with the result of previous studies which also found education to be positively related to wellbeing (Uwaegbute and Oke (2004) ; Udensi, Ifenkwe, and Ashiegbu (2015) ).\nOccupation\nThe result showed that most of the occupation groups were significantly related to wellbeing with the exception of services and household and domestic. While some of these groups showed a positive relationship to wellbeing, the others showed a negative relationship. Agriculture as occupation showed a negative relationship to wellbeing. This implies that women whose primary occupation is agriculture are likely to have reduced wellbeing than their counterparts while those in formal occupation have increased wellbeing. This result supports that of previous studies (Adeyemo and Oni 2012).\nFertility (Total children born)\nThe level of fertility, measured by the total number of children born, was found to be significantly related to wellbeing. The negative coefficient of fertility implies that the more children a woman has, the lower her wellbeing.\n\n\n\nEffect of fertility on wellbeingBody.mass.indexCoefficientStandard.Errort.value Age of respondent0.0963***0.0036026.60HHhead Age0.00150.001900.75Marital statusLiving with partner -0.2981**0.12830-2.32Widowed -0.2233**0.11340-1.97Divorced0.1480.171700.86Separated -0.18760.16890-1.11Household size-0.00660.00640-1.04Educational levelPrimary0.6391***0.0572011.17Secondary1.1377***0.0653017.42Higher2.5235***0.1135022.23Occupation groupedProfessional/technical/managerial0.3404***0.124402.74Clerical0.9448***0.321502.94Sales 0.4893***0.052109.39Agricultural - self employed0.6304**0.255202.47            Agricultural - employee  -0.2438***0.06510-3.74            Household and domestic-0.57260.59260-0.97Services 0.17050.109901.55Skilled manual -0.11890.07330-1.62Unskilled manual1.5589**0.656502.37Wealth indexMiddle0.6295***0.0558011.27rich  1.8405***0.0627029.36Fertility (Total children born)-0.0277***0.01020-2.71Use of birth control0.01820.062400.29Region North East -0.7005***0.06812-10.28North West -0.8499***0.06710-12.66South East -0.4702***0.08420-5.59South South-0.06010.07690-0.78South West -0.6000***0.07750-7.74Time20130.51590.0422012.24Constant18.96980.10790175.79*** significant at 10%   ** significant at 5%Prob &gt; F: 0.0000  Author's computation, 2019"

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThe socio-economic characteristics, fertility and wellbeing levels, use of birth control methods, effect of birth control on fertility and wellbeing of rural women were measured and analysed. Based on these, this study found the following:\n\nAmong the rural women considered in the dataset, very few fell within the age range 15-19 while majority of the women in rural Nigeria are within the age range 25-29. The average age of a rural Nigerian woman is 31. On the other hand, majority of the household heads are within the age range 31-40 and the average age of the household heads is 43. Also, the highest percentage of women sampled belong to households containing 4-6 members and 7-9 members. Majority of the women sampled have no education or only primary education. The case was also similar for the womens’ husbands, however, a higher percentage of the husbands has secondary education unlike the women who had primary education. A large percentage of rural women were found to be unemployed; the major occupational activities were found to be sales and agricultural activities and a large majority of the rural population was found to be poor. Most of the women samples were from the northern regions.\nMajority of the women had knowledge of birth control methods while few had no knowledge. However, the use of birth control was found to be low, that is, contraceptive prevalence rate is low, as very few women currently used while a large majority did not use any birth control methods. The most common birth control methods used by these women include injections, withdrawal method, condoms, periodic abstinence and use of pills. While a few women intend to use birth control methods in future, majority of the women still did not intend to use birth control methods.\nThe number of children born to most women was within 3-5 children per woman, 0-2 children and 6-8 children.\nThe wellbeing of most women, assessed by their BMI was found to be normal while others had relatively low levels of wellbeing.\nIn assessing the effect of birth control methods on fertility, a regression model was fitted with eight explanatory variables. The results of the regression analysis showed that age, region, educational level, wealth index, occupation, marital status and use of birth control methods were found to significantly affect the level of fertility of rural Nigerian women.\nThe regression model used to assess the effect of fertility of wellbeing of rural women was fitted with nine explanatory variables. The results showed that age, region of residence, educational level, marital status, occupation, household size, marital status and total number of children ever born were all significantly related to wellbeing levels of rural women."

    "text": "5.2 Conclusion\nBased on the empirical evidences obtained from the study, the following conclusions were drawn:\n\nThe level of education, employment and wealth status are low in rural Nigeria. Although, there seems to be a little improvement in the quality of lives of the rural population, the standard of living is still quite low in these areas.\nIt can also be concluded that although the knowledge of birth control methods is high, the contraceptive prevalence rate in rural Nigeria is low as seen in the percentage of women who use birth control. It can be further concluded that the CPR is not likely to increase much as a lot of women still do not intend to use birth control from the study. We can also conclude that most birth control methods used in rural Nigeria are traditional methods and few modern methods. However, the study shows a gradual move to modern methods.\nThe fertility rate in rural Nigeria is gradually reducing as seen in the total number of children born to the women, as more women are having fewer children.\nThe fertility rate was reduced with time from 2008 to 2013 and this could be as a result of the little increase in the use of birth control methods. We can therefore conclude that birth control methods are effective in controlling fertility.\nThere was an increase in the wellbeing of the rural women over time, a positive relationship between birth control use and wellbeing, as well as a negative relationship between fertility rate and wellbeing. Hence, it can be concluded that the use of birth control is effective in controlling fertility and therefore in increasing wellbeing levels."

    "text": "5.3 Recommendations\nBased on the results obtained from this study, the following recommendations are made in a bid to ensure improved use of birth control methods, effective fertility control and improved wellbeing:\n\nIn order to bridge the knowledge/practice gap in the use of birth control methods, government/health practitioners/policy makers should take active steps in increasing awareness campaigns, especially in rural areas, on the importance of birth control, choices available and its benefits. Increased use of birth control should be encouraged since it was identified that birth control use will curb high fertility rates.\nLevel of education was found to be negatively related to fertility, therefore, post-primary education for women in rural Nigeria should be promoted, especially in the northern region. This would enable women have increased participation in the labour force, increase their age at marriage and provide better information about their reproductive lives. Better education would also help improve the wellbeing of rural households; hence, policies should be directed at promoting female education in Nigeria.\nThere should be more commitment to social programs to improve the socio-economic status of the rural Nigerian women, as uneducated, unemployed women and women in the poor category are less likely to use birth control. Hence, an improvement in socio-economic status of these women would most likely increase the contraceptive prevalence rate in the country. Programs should also be directed at improving the wellbeing of the rural population by improving their access to safe drinking water and better housing materials. Therefore, government and non-governmental organizations should pay more attention to improving the welfare of rural Nigerian women.\n\n\nReferences"

    "text": "2.3 Nigeria’s Non-Oil Sectoral Export and GDP Trend from 2016-2021\nGiven the graphical analysis presented in Figures 1-2.2.5, it can be established that both the non-oil sectoral exports and GDP trended upward during 2016-2021, and thus supported the argument put forward by the ELGH (i.e., export stimulates growth). Though, the trend pattern for agricultural goods export was shown to be divergent between 2018 and 2020 while a similar divergent trend was experienced for solid mineral and raw material exports between 2017-2020. The trend pattern for manufactured goods export was relatively divergent between 2020-2021. The sharp fall in the GDP and the respective sector export in 2020 was due to the COVID-19 outbreak."

    "text": "2.4 Empirical Framework\nRecent empirical research on Nigerian non-oil export can be classified into two categories: those that focus on the influence of non-oil export on Nigerian economic growth and those that focus on the determinants of Nigerian non-oil export. Empirical studies such as Vincent (2017), Sajo and Li (2017), Kromtit et al. (2017), Anthony-Orji et al. (2017), Bolaji, Oluwaseyi Adedayo, and Y Olorunfemi (2018), Tonuchi and Onyebuchi (2019), and Osabohien et al. (2019) employed times series econometrics techniques (such as OLS, ARDL, VEC & Granger causality) to examine the impact of non-oil export on Nigeria’s economic growth. The study’s findings supported the export-led growth hypothesis as they showed that non-oil exports contribute positively to Nigeria’s economic growth during the periods studied.\nOne empirical work that is close to ours is the study of Awoke, Awoke, and Obaji (2019) whose study focus was to examine the impact of agriculture and manufacturing sectors on economic growth in Nigeria. However, the study made use of agriculture and manufacturing output (in contrast to agriculture and manufacturing export used in this study) as regressors and thus examine the relationships between sectoral outputs and Nigeria’s economic growth rather than sectoral export and growth.\nOther related empirical works such as Musibau et al. (2017), Alimi (2017), Okechukwu, De Vita, and Luo (2018), Alegwu, Aye, and Asogwa (2018) and Beecroft et al. (2020) concerted on the determinants of non-oil export in Nigeria using regressor such as exchange rate, foreign direct investment and globalization among others. The study outcomes thus vary.\nThe foregoing review of existing empirical works on non-oil export and growth nexus indicated that there is homonymous agreement among researchers that non-oil export influences Nigeria’s economic growth positively. However, sectoral analyses were not provided as these studies made use of aggregated non-oil export data sets rather than disaggregating them according to sectoral exports. As a result, sectors specific impact of non-oil export on economic growth was not examined. Consequently, this study is carried out to examine the impact of non-oil export (i.e., agriculture, manufacturing, solid mineral and Raw Material export) on Nigeria’s economic growth using quarterly data set from 2016 to 2020. This is to examine if this homonymous agreement among scholars holds true for these sectors."

    "text": "3.1 Data and Estimation Technique\nThe study made use of data sets such as GDP, real effective exchange rate, exports (total export and export by sectors), and total import. Due to the fact that non-oil sectoral export data sets are limited to 2016-2021, we thus consider quarterly data sets to increase the time frame and estimation precision. The GDP at 2010 constant prices and real effective exchange rate data sets were sourced from the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Statistical Bulletin-Real Sector (2022) and the NBS Statistical Bulletin-External Sector (2022) respectively. The export and import data sets were sourced from the NBS Foreign Trade Statistics (2017 & 2021).\nTo analyze the data sourced the study thus made use of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model, and the justification for employing the ARDL is based on the unit-root test result presented in Table 4.1.1. This study made use of STATA 13 econometrics software to carry out the estimation and numerous tests."

    "text": "3.2 Model specification\nOur model specification is guided by the export-led growth hypothesis and empirical works of Anthony-Orji et al. (2017) and Awoke et al. (2019). The basic model is given as follows\n\\[\nLNGDP = F (LNNEXP, LNTOP, LNREXR) {\\tag{3.1}}\n\\]\nWhere \\(LNGDP\\) is the log of \\(GDP\\) (a measure of economic growth), \\(LNNEXP\\) is the log of non-oil export; it is disaggregated into four, namely log of manufactured export \\((lnmnexp)\\), log of agricultural export \\((lnagexp)\\), log of solid mineral export \\((lnsmexp)\\), and log of raw material exports \\((lnrmexp)\\), \\(LNTOP\\) is the log of trade openness (it is calculated as a sum of imports and exports divided by GDP) and it is a measure of international competitiveness, and LNREXR is the log of the real effective exchange rate.\nNote: We limited the model regressor to 3 variables since the ARDL model uses the lag value of the dependent variable as an additional regressor. Also, we suggested a logarithmic form of the model in the equations above to allow us to interpret the coefficients as elasticity. The ARDL econometric form of equation 3.1 is thus stated as follows\n\\[\n\\Delta LNGDP = \\beta_0 +\\delta_1ECM_{t-i}+\\sum^{k1} _ {i=1} \\gamma_i \\Delta LNGDP_{t-i} + \\sum^{k2} _ {i=0} \\Phi_i \\Delta LNNEXP_{t-i} +\n\\] \\[\n\\sum^{k3} _ {i=0} \\Omega_i \\Delta LNTOP_{t-i} + \\sum^{k4} _ {i=0} \\eta_i \\Delta LNEXR_{t-i} + \\lambda_1 LNGDP_{t-i} +  \\lambda_2\n\\] \\[\nLNNEXP_{t-i} + \\lambda_3 LNTOP_{t-i} + \\lambda_4 LNEXR_{t-i} + \\epsilon_i          {\\tag{3.2}}\n\\]\nThe first part (i.e.,\\(Υ_i\\),\\(ϕ_i\\),\\(Ω_i\\) and \\(η_i\\) ) of equation 3.2 represents the short-run dynamics while \\(λ_1-λ_4\\) is the long-run dynamics. The \\(∂_1 ECM_(t-i)\\)is the error correction term and it measures the speed of adjustment if there is long-run disequilibrium, t stands for time, $β_0 $ is the intercept and E_t is the error term. Our main variable of interest is the coefficients of \\(LNNEXP_(t-i)\\) (i.e., \\(ϕ_i\\) and \\(λ_2\\)) which will be obtained by estimating model 3.2. Each model will be estimated by switching to a non-oil sector export variable (i.e., manufactured, agricultural, solid mineral and raw material export)."

The maximum GDP for the country was US$203.29 billion and the minimum value of GDP in the period under consideration US$157 billion. The average manufacturing export in the period was US$211.690 and with a maximum of US$996.78 and a minimum of US$317.12. While agricultural export in Nigeria was on the average US$67.90 billion with a maximum of US$16.54 billion and a minimum of US$12.85 billion. The average solid mineral export over the period is US$10.29billion with a maximum of US$26.92, and a minimum of US$11.94 billion. Also, the average raw material export in the period under consideration was US$4.32 billion while US$24.84 billion and US$5.76 billion were maximum and minimum values respectively. Furthermore, we can observe that Nigeria is somewhat open to international trade on the average, as it recorded an average trade openness value was US$410 billion over the period with a maximum of US$581 billion and a minimum of US$196 billion. Lastly, the average real effective exchange rate over the period is N82.54 to US$1, its maximum is N104.24 to US$1, and its minimum is N64.27 to US$1.\n\n\n\nDescriptive StatisticsVariableGDPMNEXPAGEXPSMEXPRMEXPTOPREXRObs24.000024.0000024.000024.000024.000024.000024.00000Mean17,500.80000.2116967,903.400010,292.300043,224.9000410.090082.50000Std.

The kurtosis statistic shows that the dependent variable, GDP, AGEXP, SMEXP, TOP and REXR are platykurtic; having kurtosis statistic of less than 3. While only MNEXP and RMEXP are in excess kurtosis (k&gt;3). The Jarque-Bera statistic which combines the skewness and kurtosis statistics to determine the normality of the variable reveals that the normality hypothesis can be rejected for MNEXP, and RMEXP at 5% level of significance, implying that they are not normally distributed. While all other variables are found to be normally distributed.\nWe commence preliminary analysis by examining the correlation between the variables of interest. The correlation was conducted on the main variables rather than the transformed variables in the analysis. The result of the correlation is presented in Table 4.3. The result shows that there is no perfect (one-to-one) correlation between any two regressors, suggesting that the problem of multicollinearity can be least expected. Apparently, GDP bearly correlates with REXR but it correlates with other variables. This has no implication for multicollinearity as it is a correlation between a dependent and an independent variable.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis GDPMNEXPAGEXPSMEXPRMEXPTOPREXRGDP1MNEXP0.21981.0000AGEXP0.06300.23841.0000SMEXP-0.0846-0.09870.15881.0000RMEXP0.51770.21770.51060.26771.0000TOP0.32380.51960.71990.27680.57811.0000REXR-0.1081-0.1862-0.28760.6001-0.3099-0.11111"

    "text": "4.2 Unit Root Test\nUnit root test was conducted in further preliminary analysis. Unit root test is a test for stationarity of the series. This is necessary as regressing a non-stationary variable on another non-stationary variable could lead to spurious regression. The test was conducted using two conventional unit root tests; Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF), and Phillip-Perron (P-P) Tests. A (level) series is stationary I(0) if the unit root null hypothesis can be rejected. If the unit root null hypothesis can be rejected only after the series has been first-differenced, the series is I(1). The results of the tests are presented in Table 4.4. The result shows that LNGDP is the only variable that is found to be stationary at level, I(0) while other variables are stationary after first difference I(1). There is high level of consistency between the ADF and PP results. The unit root results suggest that relevant method for conducting cointegration among these variables must account for mixed orders of integration. Hence, this study is using ARDL bound testing cointegration approach. That is, the result shows that the study’s variables are mixed stationary (i.e., I(0) and I(1) ) which thus makes the ARDL model an appropriate model to be used for the model estimation.\n\n\n\nUnit Root ResultsVariablesADF TestPhillip-Perron TestLevelFirst DiffRemarkLevelFirst DiffRemarkLNGDP-6.930***-8.524***I(0)-3.453***-4.882***I(0)LNMNEXP-1.81-4.211***I(1)-2.506-8.284***I(1)LNAGEXP-2.169-6.016***I(1)-2.164-6.625***I(1)LNSMEXP-2.382-2.535I(1)-2.217-4.196***I(1)LNRMEXP-1.11-4.038***I(1)-0.543-5.338***I(1)LNTOP-1.813-2.972*I(1)-2.455-5.538***I(1)LNREXR-1.855-6.623***I(1)-1.927-4.638***I(1)Source: Computed by the Author\n\n\nNote: The unit root results presented are from the best unit root models after modelling with constant, constant & trend, and with none.

Put differently, the positive effect of the increased manufactured, agriculture and solid mineral export from 2016-2021 does not result in a substantial rise in the country’s economic growth while the raw material export contributed substantially to the economic growth during the said period.\nFurthermore, the elasticity coefficients of the log of manufactured export (lnmnexp) and the log of agricultural export (lnagexp) were shown to be lower when compared to solid mineral export (lnsmexp) and raw material export (lnrmexp), implying that the economic growth benefit derived from manufactured and agricultural exports were comparatively lower during 2016-2021 despite numerous efforts towards improving the sector’s outputs and competitiveness.\nAlso, the log of trade openness (lntop) and real effective exchange rate (lnrexr) were found to be significantly positive and negative respectively, Implying that a substantial economic growth benefit was derived from trade openness during the period studied, however, the increase in real effective exchange rate hindered the country’s economic growth during the same period.\nThe coefficients elasticity of the short-run estimates for all the non-oil sector exports included in the models were all shown to be negative and insignificant except the raw material export (lnrmexp) which was also negative but significant. Though the short-run estimates are not our main interest in this study, however, the negative coefficients could be due to the fact that the short-runs are usually periods of learning characterized by a narrow portfolio of exports and higher cost of production, often time economies start to reap the benefits of their export when they start to experience economics of scale."

Secondary data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey for 2008 and 2013 were used in the study. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The results show that knowledge of birth control methods is high in rural areas (85%), however, contraceptive prevalence rate is still low (15%) and most women still do not intend to use birth control. The most common birth control method used is injections, pills, withdrawal and condoms. Majority of the women (62.1%) were found to have normal health and wellbeing as seen by their BMI. In addition, we found that wealth index, birth control use, region and occupation were all significantly related to fertility rate. The results further revealed that there has been a little decline in fertility rate over time, which could be attributed to use of birth control. The study further revealed that there has been an improvement in the level of wellbeing in rural Nigeria over time. This study concludes that increased use of birth control is key to curbing the issue of high fertility rates which goes further to improve the wellbeing of the woman.\nKEY WORDS: Fertility, Birth Control, Wellbeing, Body Mass Index, and OLS\nJEL CODE: J13, C21, I31"

Finally, a long run asymmetry is discovered in the nexus of current account-oil price with mediating role of institutions in Nigeria.

    "section": "3.1 Theoretical Framework",
    "text": "3.1 Theoretical Framework\nThe literature has explored the theory underlying the study of current account dynamics in great detail (see, Taylor (2002) . Yet it will be useful to quickly review some basic theoretical terms and notations. If the whole amount of goods produced and their potential allocation for household consumption (C), public expenditure (G), investments by firms (I), or exports (X) are considered to constitute the gross domestic product (GDP) Q, then;\n\\[\nQ+M = C + I + G + X \\tag{1}\n\\] which becomes; \\[\nGDP = Q \\equiv C + I + G + (X-M) \\tag{2}\n\\]\nwhere \\((X – M)\\) represents net exports. Actually, SMS is made up of all the current account’s debit items, whereas SXS is made up of all the credit ones. Transposing Equation (2) so that \\((X - M)\\) is on the RHS to derive the current account balance (CAD);\n\\[\nQ - (C + I + G) = (X - M) \\tag{3}\n\\]\nThis equation demonstrates that the (CAD) is simply the difference between an economy’s GDP (Q) and its population’s GDP (C + I + G) under the period under review. An economy with a deficit balance \\((X - M_0)\\) is one that is living above its means and paying more in taxes than it is taking in. Consequently, \\(C + I + G &gt; Q\\).\nAccording to Chuku (2011), this was the situation in Nigeria between the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s (2011). However, if a country has a balance surplus (i.e., \\(X - M &gt; 0\\)), it signifies that it is bringing in more income above its spending, which causes \\(Q\\) to be greater than \\(C + I + G\\). Since 1981, this has been happening in Japan (Appleyard and Field, 2001).\nOn the other hand, when we employ the savings-investment approach to depict the identity of national income, anomalies in the current account fluctuations become more understandable. Hence, GDP can be written as;\n\\[\nGDP = Q \\equiv C + S + T \\tag{4}\n\\]\nTaking \\(S\\) as savings and \\(T\\) as taxes. Equation (5) suggests that revenue from output can be utilized for saving, paying taxes, and spending (including imports). Equations (2) and (4), which demonstrate the equivalence of variables with \\(Q\\), can then be combined to provide;\n\\[\nC + I + G + (X-M) = C + S + T \\tag{5}\n\\] Collecting like terms and solving,\n\\[\nX - M = (S - C) + (T - G) - I   \\tag{6}\n\\]\n\\[\nCAD = Pr_{savings} + Pub_{savings} - Investment \\tag{7}\n\\]\nThe discrepancy between a nation’s investments and savings, assuming \\((T - G)\\) stands for government savings and \\((S - C)\\) for private savings, is the CA balance \\((X - M)\\). An economy’s CAD therefore indicates that it is spending more than it is saving.\nDetermining the influences of oil price shocks on a country’s current account dynamics is the next problem that arises from the theoretical development discussed above. The rigorous distinction between the effects of oil price fluctuations induced by oil supply spikes and oil price variations driven by demand shocks in oil, as was the case during the recent Covid-19 outbreak, is crucial to understanding how oil price volatility are transmitted to the CA of oil-exporting economies. L. Kilian (2009) have made this claim in a few studies that knowing the fundamental determinant of spikes in oil price is essential to comprehending the consequences on external balances (Bodenstein 2008).\nAccording to the literature, the dynamics of the CA can be impacted by the variations in the price of oil through in five key channels: the supply-side, demand-side, monetary policy, trade, and valuation in that order. Dependent on the institutional structure of the nation, its state of development economically, and whether it is an oil-exporting developing or advanced economy or an oil-importing emerging or advanced economy, will determine the efficiency and smooth functioning of any given channel. L. Kilian (2009) and its references gave a thorough explanation of these channels. The channels of monetary policy, trade, and valuation are important to the Nigerian economy. The study by Bernanke (1997) that discovered that monetary authorities’ systematic and anticipated responses to oil price shocks tend to aggravate recessionary pressures in the economy is the basis for the monetary policy channel. As a result, these reactions lead to recessions that could have been averted by keeping interest rates constant at greater costs to inflation. The valuations pathway of transmission, in contrast, operates via shifts in overall financial assets inequities and is expressed in earnings and valuation changes. This is based on the initial gross foreign asset and foreign liability positions of an economy. On the other hand, the trade channel functions by adjustments to the quantities and costs of products imported and exported, which are recorded in the trade account Kirián (2010). Once more, it is believed that a crucial factor in ensuring that this influence is effectively communicated is the concern of international economy harmony and integration."

    "section": "3.2 Analytical Technique",
    "text": "3.2 Analytical Technique\nFollowing Ito (2007), we employed the NARDL methodology introduced by Shin et al. (2011) in this paper. This is partly because the NARDL specification can accept the insertion of interaction terms, which allow the oil price-CAD relationship to alter over time in accordance with the degree of institutional development and to offer the threshold value of institutional evolution at which the evolution of the nexus change.\nThe ARDL empirical specification for our investigation can be expressed in equation (8) according to Pesaran (2001) original framework, which is as follows:\n\\[\n\\bigtriangleup LCAD_t = \\alpha_0 + \\beta_1 LCAD_{t-1} + \\beta_2 LOILP_{t-1} + \\beta_3INS_{t-1} + \\beta_4LFDI_{t-1} + \\beta_5LNEXR_{t-1}\n\\] \\[\n+ \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N1} \\lambda_{1i} \\bigtriangleup LCAD_{t-1} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N2} \\lambda_{2i} \\bigtriangleup LOILP_{t-j} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N3} \\lambda_{3i} \\bigtriangleup INS_{t-j}\n\\]\n\\[+ \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N4} \\lambda_{4i} \\bigtriangleup LFDI_{t-j} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N5} \\lambda_{5i} \\bigtriangleup Lnexr_{t-j} + \\varepsilon_t   \\tag{8}\n\\]\nThe sample ARDL model, which includes both long run and short run estimates, is represented by Equation (8). The intercept and slope parameters’ long run parameters are calculated as; \\(-\\frac{\\alpha_0}{\\beta_1}\\) intercept, \\(-\\frac{\\beta_2}{\\beta_1}\\) \\(-\\frac {\\beta_3} {\\beta_1}\\), \\(-\\frac {\\beta_4} {\\beta_1}\\) and \\(-\\frac {\\beta_5} {\\beta_1}\\) for the coefficient of oil price, institutional quality, FDI, and nominal exchange rate, respectively. the short run estimates are obtained as \\(\\Sigma_{j=0}^{N2} \\lambda_{2i}\\) for oil price,\\(\\Sigma_{j=0}^{N3} \\lambda_{3i}\\) for institutions, \\(\\Sigma_{j=0}^{N4} \\lambda_{4i}\\) for FDI, and \\(\\Sigma_{j=0}^{N5} \\lambda_{5i}\\) for NEXR. The sum of the short run parameters is determined using Wald test for joint significance, with the restriction that \\(\\Sigma_{j=0}^{N2} \\lambda_{2i} = 0\\)\nOur ARDL model tests for cointegration using bounds testing technique which has to do with upper- and lower-bounds. The test uses a F distribution, therefore cointegration is present if the estimated F-statistic is higher than the upper bound, not present if it is lower than the lower bound, and inconclusive if it falls in the middle of the two bounds (Pesaran et al. (2001). Equation (8) is modified to incorporate an error correction element as shown below to determine the rate of adjustment in a cointegrating ARDL model:\n\\[\n\\bigtriangleup LCAD_t = \\delta \\upsilon_{t-1} +  \\Sigma_{i=1}^{N1} \\lambda_{1i} \\bigtriangleup LCAD_{t-1} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N2} \\lambda_{2i} \\bigtriangleup LOILP_{t-j}\n\\]\n\\[\n+ \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N3} \\lambda_{3i} \\bigtriangleup INS_{t-j} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N4} \\lambda_{4i} \\bigtriangleup LFDI_{t-j} + \\Sigma_{j=0}^{N5} \\lambda_{5i} \\bigtriangleup Lnexr_{t-j} + \\varepsilon_t   \\tag{9}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\upsilon_{t-1}\\) is the lagged error correction term calculated as \\(\\upsilon_{t-1} = LCAD_{t-1} - \\beta_1^* - \\beta_2^*OILP_{t-1} - \\beta_3^*LINS_{t-1} - \\beta_4^*LFDI_{t-1} - \\beta_5^*LNEXR_{t-1}\\) where \\(\\beta_1^*\\), \\(\\beta_2^*\\), \\(\\beta_3^*\\), \\(\\beta_4^*\\), and \\(\\beta_5^*\\) equal \\(- \\frac {\\alpha_0}{\\beta_1}\\) \\(- \\frac {\\beta_2} {\\beta_1}\\), \\(-\\frac {\\beta_3} {\\beta_1}\\), \\(-\\frac {\\beta_4} {\\beta_1}\\) and \\(-\\frac {\\beta_5} {\\beta_1}\\) for intercept coefficient of oil price, institutional variable, FDI, and NEXR, respectively.\nShin et al. (2011) establish a nonlinear ARDL cointegration technique (NARDL) as an asymmetric version of the well-known ARDL model of Pesaran (1999) and Pesaran et al. (2010) in order to account for both long run and short run asymmetries in a variable of interest (2001). We use this modeling strategy to achieve our goals. In fact, this specification permits current-account regression coefficients to change over time, depending on the nation’s institutional evolution. In more detail, the data are split into two regimes, each of which is defined by the threshold attained by institutional development, with predicted coefficients that vary based on the regime under consideration.\nThe following asymmetric long-run equation of the current account and the change in oil prices with the institution as an interaction variable in percent of GDP is what we start with ((Schorderet 2003) and Shin et al., 2011):\n\\[\nCA_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\bigtriangleup OILP_t + \\beta_2(OILP_t * Ins)^+ + \\beta_3(OILP_t * Ins)^- + \\varepsilon_t   \\tag{10}\n\\]\nWhere, \\(\\bigtriangleup OILP_t\\) is the price of crude expressed in log of first difference, \\((OILP_t * Ins)\\) is the interactions of oil price with institutional factors, and \\(\\alpha = \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3\\) is to be estimated a cointegrating vector or a vector of long run parameters. In (1), \\((OILP_t * Ins)^+\\) and \\((OILP_t * Ins)^-\\) are the interactive variable’s partial sums of positive and negative \\((ΔOILP_t*Ins)^{..}.\\)\n\\[\n(OILP*Ins)_t^+ = ∑_{i=1}^tΔ(OILP*Ins)_i^+ = ∑_{i=1}^t max⁡(Δ(OILP*Ins)_i,0)\\tag{11}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n(OILP*Ins)_t^- = ∑_{i=1}^tΔ(OILP*Ins)_i^- = ∑_{i=1}^t min⁡(Δ(OILP*Ins)_i,0)\\tag{12}\n\\]\nAccording to the aforementioned formulation, the long-term relationship between the current account price and the price of oil with the rise in Nigerian institutions is \\(β_2\\), which is anticipated to be positive. In the meantime, \\(β_3\\) captures the institutional interaction reduction between the current account and oil price over the long term. They are anticipated to move together, thus \\(β_3\\) is anticipated to be positive. We additionally hypothesize that, compared to the current account impact of an oil price reduction of the same magnitude, the oil price-institution interaction increases will lead to bigger long-term changes in the current account, i.e. \\(β_2 &gt; β_3\\). As a result, the long-term relationship shown by (8) shows an unbalanced long-run pass-through of the oil price-institutional interaction to the current account in Nigeria.\nAccording to Pesaran (1999) and Pesaran (2001), equation (1) can be framed in an ARDL framework as follows:\n\\[\nΔCA_t = α + β_0 CA_{t-1} + β_1 OILP_{t-1} + β_2 (OILP*Ins)_t^+ + β_3 (OILP*Ins)_t^-\n\\] \\[\n+ ∑_{i=0}^p φ_i ΔCA_{t-1} + ∑_{i=0}^q γ_i ΔOILP_{t-i} + ∑_{i=0}^sϕ_i^+Δ(OILP*Ins)_t^+ + ϕ_i^- Δ(OILP*Ins)_t^-)+μ_t \\tag{13}\n\\]\nWith p, q, and s are lag orders and other variables are as defined above, \\(α_2 = −β_2/β_0, α_3 = −β_3/β_0\\), the long-term effects on the current account of the foregoing increase and decrease in oil prices-institutions. \\(∑_{i=0}^sϕ_i^+\\) gauges the short-term effects of oil price-institutional increases on current account imbalances while \\(∑_{i=0}^sϕ_i^-\\) the short run effects of oil price-institutional decreases on current account imbalances. So, in this scenario, the asymmetric short-run effects of changes in oil price-institutions on current account deficits are also captured in addition to the asymmetric long-run relation.\nThe following steps are involved in the implementation of our nonlinear ARDL technique. This is done by determining the order of integration of the variables using the well-known ADF and PP unit root tests. We estimate equation (13) in the subsequent step using the common OLS estimation technique. Like in Katrakilidis and Trachanas (2012), we use the general-to-specific method to remove inconsequential lags in order to reach the NARDL model’s final specification. Third, using a limits testing approach developed by Pesaran (2001) and Shin et al. (2011), we test for the presence of cointegration among the variables based on the predicted NARDL. The analysis of long- and short-term asymmetries in the relationships between oil-prices and current account deficit is done in the final stage, with cointegration present, and conclusions drawn. We may also calculate the asymmetric cumulative dynamic multiplier effects of a 1% change in this step \\((OILP*Ins)_i^+\\) and \\((OILP*Ins)_i^-\\) respectively as\n\\[\nm_h^+=∑_{j=0}^h \\frac {∂OILP_{t+j}}{∂(OILP*Ins)_{t-1}^+}, m_h^-=∑_{j=0}^h \\frac {∂OILP_{t+j}}{∂(OILP*Ins)_{t-1}^-}    h = 1, 2, 3 ...\n\\]\nNote as \\(h→∞,m_h^+→α_2,m_h^-→α_3\\)"

    "text": "4.1 Data and Preliminary Analyses\nInformation regarding the data used for the analysis in this study is provided in Table 4.1. These consist of our dependent variable, ratio of current account to GDP, and its potential determinants such as the oil price (OILP), expressed in log form, institutional indicators that include rule of law, accountability, political stability, government performance, and regulatory quality. as well as control variables. The data are of annual frequency ranging from 1981 to 2020.\n\n\n\nDescription and sources of DataVariablesAcronymsMeasurementCurrent Account Balance (%GDP)CADBillion US$Oil Price (US$)OILPBrent oil price seriesInstitutional DepthINSA Simple AverageTrade OpennessOpennessTrade (% of GDP)Terms of TradeTOTratio of export prices to import pricesForeign Direct InvestmentFDIForeign direct investment, net inflows (% of GDP)Nominal Exchange RateNEROfficial exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average)Source: CAD, Openness, TOT, FDI and NER - World Development Indicator (WDI)OILP - Federal Reserves of St. Louis at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/.INS - Worldwide Governance Indicators\n\n\nTable 4.2 displays the descriptive statistics for these variables. The table shows that Nigerian current account balance on average within this period is US1$5.1 billion. The maximum CAD for the country was US$36.5 billion which was recorded in 2005 and 2006. The minimum value of CAD in the period under consideration (-US$17 billion) was recorded in 2020. Oil cost an average of $42.73 a barrel throughout that time. While the maximum oil price over this period (US$111.57) was recorded in 2012, its minimum (US$12.75) was recorded in 1998. While institutional rating in Nigeria was on the average -1.13 with a maximum rating of -0.99 and a minimum of -1.27 in year 2000 and 2002 respectively. The average nominal exchange rate rate over the period is N100.76 to US$1, its maximum is N358.81 to US$1, and its minimum is N0.62to US$1 in year 2020 and 1981 respectively. Also, the average FDI inflows in the period under consideration was US$1.5billion while US$5.79 billion and US$0.19 billion were maximum and minimum values respectively. Furthermore, we can observe that Nigeria is somewhat open to international trade on the average, as it recorded an average trade openness value less than 50 percent of GDP over the period. It recorded its largest trade openness value of 53.27 percent of GDP in 2011 when its economy experienced GDP rebasing. The openness of Nigeria to international trade recorded its minimum trade openness values of 9.135 percent of GDP in 1986.\n\n\n\nDescriptive StatisticsVariablesCADOILPOpennessTOTInstitutionsFDINERObs40.00041.00039.00040.00040.00040.00040.000Mean5.10042.73332.3010.316-1.1281.500100.760Std.

The kurtosis statistic shows that the dependent variable, OILP, Openness, TOT, Institutions, and NER are platykurtic; having kurtosis statistic of less than 3. While only CAD and FDI are in excess kurtosis (k&gt;3). The Jarque-Bera statistic which combines the skewness and kurtosis statistics to determine the normality of the variable reveals that the normality hypothesis can be rejected for CADL, and OILP at 5% level of significance, implying that they are not normally distributed. The null is also rejected for FDI and NER at 1% and 10% level of significance respectively. While only Openness, TOT and Institutions are found to be normally distributed.\nWe start our preliminary analysis by looking at the relationships among the variables involved. Instead of using the transformed variables in the analysis, the correlation was performed on the original variables. Table 4.6 displays the correlation’s results. The finding indicates that no two regressors have a perfect (one-to-one) correlation, which suggests that the multicollinearity issue is less likely than previously thought. Apparently, CAD bearly correlates with institutions but it correlates positively with other variables. OILP corelates positively with other variables except with TOT. Trade openness on the other hand, correlates positively with all other variables in the models. This has no implication for multicollinearity as it is a correlation between a dependent and an independent variable.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis CADOILPOpennessTOTInstitutionsFDINERCAD1OILP0.54061.0000Openness0.35480.34121.0000TOT0.2039-0.17510.42051.0000Institutions-0.00190.16200.1504-0.25501.0000FDI0.26040.01060.29680.4950-0.15641.000NER0.25520.65490.2674-0.19630.4613-0.1151\n\n\nAnother preliminary investigation was done using the unit root test. This is essential because it is possible for a non-stationary variable to cause a misleading regression when it is regressed on another non-stationary variable. Three common unit root tests—the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF), Phillip-Perron (P-P), and Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Tests—were used to run the test. In Table 4.4, the test results are displayed. The outcome demonstrates that whereas other variables are stationary at level, I(0), the current account deficit (CAD), oil price (OILP), trade openness, and nominal exchange rate (NER) are stationary after the first difference, I(1). The ADF and PP results are very consistent with one another.

    "text": "4.2 Empirical Analy1sis\n\n4.2.1 Main Analysis\nAt first, we analysed the nexus between CAD and OILP in Nigeria based on the baseline model (eq. 3), where CAD is regressed on oil price (OILP), and institutions. Table 4.6 displays the results of the bound test for the cointegration of these variables. As a result, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected because the estimated F exceeds the upper bound I(0) of F tabulated at both the 10% and 5% level of statistical significance. implying that the country’s current account deficit (CAD) and Nigeria’s macroeconomic fundamentals (oil price and institutions) are cointegrated. The presence of cointegration indicates that the current account and macroeconomic factors are related in the short and/or long runs (oil price and institutions).\n\n\n\nThe Bounds Test ResultBound Test Result10%5%1%p-valueI(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)F3.2954.4354.0765.3815.9487.6280.0090.03T-2.538-3.206-2.891-3.596-3.611-4.3830.0030.016Decision.r.r.\n\n\nThe ARDL result for the baseline model is presented in Table 4.7. There may be a long-term association because the coefficient of the error correction term in the result (-0.831) is negative, less than 1 in absolute terms, and statistically significant. This corroborates the conclusion from the bounds test. Given size of this ECM, it suggests that 83% of disequilibrium in current account deficit caused by changes in the explanatory variables will be annually. In other words, it will take approximately 1 year for the full effect of any disequilibrium to be fully neutralized or for long run to be achieved. More significantly, the outcome demonstrates a short-term link between Nigeria’s current account deficits and oil prices. This is clear since oil prices have a big short impact on current account. Likewise, over time, the price of oil has a favorable and statistically significant impact (5.3651) on the current account balance. Suggesting that 1% percent appreciation in oil price will cause current account balance to grow by 5.37% in the long run. Meanwhile, institutional variable exhibits no long run impact on current account balance.\n\n\n\nARDL Results for the Baseline ModelVariableCoef.Std.

The results reveal that the null hypothesis of no serial correlation cannot be rejected; as D-W is very close to 2. The F-stat of the ARCH effect is not statistically significant, hence the null hypothesis that there is no conditional heteroscedasticity cannot be ruled out either.

In Table 4.9, the results of the bound test for this cointegration test are shown. The conclusion demonstrates that the estimated F exceeds the upper bound I(0) of F tabulated at 10%, 5%, and 1% level of statistical significance, and the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected. Implying that Nigeria’s institutions weaken the relationship between the current account balance (CAD) and the price of crude.

The error correction term’s coefficient in the outcome (-0.874) is negative, statistically significant, less than 1 in absolute terms, and indicates the existence of a long run association. This corroborates the conclusion from the bounds test. Given size of this ECM, it suggests that 87% of disequilibrium in current account deficit caused by changes in the explanatory variables will be annually. In other words, it will take approximately 18 years for the full effect of any disequilibrium to be fully neutralized or for long run to be achieved. More importantly, the result demonstrates the short-term relationship between current account deficits and moderating role of institution on oil price in Nigeria. This is apparent as oil price-institution interaction significantly negatively influenced current account balance in the short run. Similar to this, an institution’s position as a moderator of the price of oil shifts to the downside over time, having a statistically significant negative impact (-0.1023) on the current account balance. This suggests that over time, a 1-unit rise in the oil sector’s poor institutional quality will result in a 0.10% decline in the current account balance.\n\n\n\nARDL Results for the Moderating Role of InstitutionVariableCoef.Std.

The extended model captures the effect of foreign direct investment and nominal exchange rate. The result of the bounds test for the extended model is presented in Table 11. The F-stat calculated is higher than the F-stat tabulated at 10% level of significance, just like under the baseline model. This shows that the current account balance and its drivers have a short- to long-term correlation. Absence of significance at 1% and 5% suggests that the association might be shaky.\nTable XII: The bounds test result\n\n\n\nThe Bounds Test Result 10%5%1%p-valueI(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)I(0)I(1)F2.6283.9753.2134.7584.6366.6490.0170.085T-2.492-3.609-2.862-4.044-3.622-4.9320.0040.055Decision.r..aNB: inconclusive (.), rejection (.r) at levels\n\n\nTable 4.13 presents the ARDL result for the extended model. The outcome demonstrates that the ECT is adverse, less than 1, and statistically significant at 1%. This supports the conclusion of the limits test that there is a long-term relationship between current account balances and its chosen determinants. However, the coefficient of the ECT (-0.896) is now higher. This suggests that failure to account for the effect of external flows (foreign direct investment and exchange rate) may cause the time adjustment factor to be over-estimated.\nMeanwhile, the finding demonstrates that only the oil price and nominal exchange rate among macroeconomic determinants have a short run impact on Nigeria’s current account balance. This supports the baseline model’s finding that the price of oil does affect current account balances in the short term. Regarding the long-term influence of the oil price, which was demonstrated to be favorable and statistically significant at 1%, it is in conflict with the conclusion from the baseline model. Hence, 1% appreciation (lower NER) resulted in a long-term depreciation (increase) of the current account balance of 0.43%.\n\n\n\nARDL Results for the Extended ModelVariableCoef.Std.

    "text": "1.1 Stylized facts on Sub-Saharan African Economies\nAt above 1 billion residents, half of whom are below 25 by 2050, SSA is a heterogeneous continent. It boasts a plethora of natural and human resources that might support sustainable development and help end poverty in the area as a whole. Africa is leveraging on its resources and population’s capabilities as the globe’s biggest free-trade zone and an economic hub of approximately 1.2 billion individuals to forge a new path for development. There is clear evidence that sub-Saharan Africa is pursuing economic development and prosperity. In the meantime, issues including forest destruction, soil deterioration, increasing desertification, wetland degradation, and pest infestations seriously threaten the ecology in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, efforts to address these problems have been impeded by a genuine lack of knowledge about their sources and possible remedies. Conventional wisdom holds that this region’s residents are highly irresponsible when it comes to the environment and that the rest of the world must intervene to prevent them from harming themselves. It frequently blames the region’s rapid population expansion and poverty for all of the environmental problems. However, there is no hard evidence that Africans have had a particularly low awareness of environmental quality, and until recently, the international community did not show any serious concern for it. Protecting Sub-Saharan Africa’s ecology must undoubtedly be looked at further and incorporated into a comprehensive strategy for sustainable economic growth (see; Mabogunje,1995).\nThe SSA countries are divided into two: the middle-income countries are the economies with per capita gross national income of more than US$995, in the years 2015–17 while the low-income economies are those with equal to or less than US$995, in the same period (World Economic Outlook, 2019). The average values of real gross domestic product (RGDP) and carbon emission (CO2) for SSA countries from 1996 to 2020 are depicted in panel A of Fig. 1. It is evident that countries with higher level of RGDP such as Nigeria and South Africa are associated with higher level of carbon emissions while in countries such as Rwanda, Eswatini and the Gambia with low level of RGDP are associated with lower level of carbon emission. However, in panel B, the average values of energy usage and carbon emissions are depicted. The pattern of the relation between these two variables appears not too discernible.\nFigure 1. Average RGDP, Energy Use and Carbon Emissions in Sub-Saharan Africa (1996–2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Author’s Computation from World Development Indicators (2021)"

    "section": "3.1 Theoretical Framework and Model Specification",
    "text": "3.1 Theoretical Framework and Model Specification\nThe theory of the treadmill of production, which highlights the manner in which the relentless pursuit of growth in the economy causes economies all over the world to become “entrapped on a treadmill,” in which their well-being cannot be enhanced by economic expansion but the consequences of this pursuit of growth creates vast, detrimental environmental damage, provides the framework to examine the relationship between energy use and environmental quality in this study. The theory focuses on how businesses, which control the production process, are the main agents driving the treadmill through energy consumption, and explores the precise driving force that maintains the system of the treadmill so tenaciously, while somehow underscoring the manner in which the state (via environmental regulations) and labor force in general keep supporting the treadmill’s continual propagation. This suggests that the pursuit of industrial growth is closely tied to energy utilization. According to the theory, environmental damage results from human pursuit of economic prosperity. The theory’s central tenet is that the increased contribution of the manufacturing activities to aggregate production that results from intensive energy utilization leads to economic growth. As more strain is being placed on the environment and carbon emissions are produced as a result of energy utilization, environmental degradation intensifies (Mesagan & Olunkwa, 2020; Padhan et al., 2019; Kahia et al., 2019). The claim that increasing energy use and economic development have negative consequences on environmental quality is thus theoretically accurate. In addition, Ahmed et al (2019) claim that globalization may encourage resource efficiency, which would reduce pollution and thereby, facilitates environmental quality. According to Destek and Sinha (2020), environmental quality is significantly influenced by trade openness. When the economy of a country is more accessible to international trade, it will have access to more energy-efficient technology, which will help to improve the unfavorable environmental situation. The model summarizing the consequences of the use of energy and regulatory factors on the environment in SSA countries following the above theoretical expositions, and Wu et al. (2021) as cited in (J. A. Afolabi 2023):\n\\[\nEQ = f(ENC,RGDP,REQ,GCI) \\tag{1}\n\\]\nWhere EQ, RGDP, REQ and GCI denote total environmental quality (proxied by \\(CO_2\\)), real GDP (a proxy for economic growth), regulatory quality and gross capital investment, in that order. The determinants are all expressed in logarithms (rep by the prefix “ln”) except the REQ which is in percentile. Thus, elasticity is used to express how the independent variables affect the quality of the environment.\nEquation (1) is represented explicitly as;\n\\[\nln⁡E Q=β_0  +β_1 ENC{i,t} + β_2  ln⁡R GDP{i,t}+β_3 REQ_{i,t}+β_4  lnG CI_{i,t}+ε_{i,t}\\tag{2}\n\\]\nwhere i represents a cross-section of countries; t stands for the years 1996 to 2020; \\(β_0\\) is the intercept; \\(β_1 - β_4\\) are each variable’s elasticities; and \\(ε\\) is the noise (error).\nIn this paper, we investigate whether the degree of trade openness among African economies affects how much energy use from industrial and domestic activities and how clean the environment becomes. Equation (3), which provides a rich method of modeling the moderating impact that internationalization has on the link between energy use and the quality of the environment in SSA, thereby captures the conditional impacts. The conditional effect is represented by include product of the trade openness and energy use as one of the explanatory factors in the equation.\n\\[\nln⁡E Q=β_0  +β_1 ENC{i,t} + β_2 lnTOP_{i,t} + β_3 lnENC{i,t}\\_  TOP_{i,t} + β_4\n\\]\n\\[\nln⁡R GDP{i,t} + β_5 REQ_{i,t} + β_6  lnG CI_{i,t}+ε_{i,t}\\tag{3}\n\\]\nwhere TOP denotes trade openness; ENC_TOP is the interactive term of energy consumption and trade openness; and all other factors stay the same as they were before. The total impact of energy consumption which includes the marginal influence of trade on the quality of environment is arrived at by taking partial derivatives of equation (3):\n\\[\n\\frac {∂EQ_{i,t}} {∂ENC_{i,t}} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3TOP_{i,t} \\tag{4}\n\\]\nThe sign and magnitude of this equation should be considered while interpreting it. Considering the sign, if \\(β_1 &gt; 0\\) and \\(β_3 &lt; 0\\), energy consumption deteriorates environmental quality (ECF) only when foreign trade offers energy-inefficient technologies. However, if \\(β_1 &lt; 0\\) and \\(β_3 &gt; 0\\), it implies that using energy-efficient technologies via foreign trade would make energy consumption enhance environmental quality (EQ). Meanwhile, if \\(β_1 &gt; 0\\) and \\(β_3 &gt; 0\\), then energy consumption and foreign trade complementarily promote environmental quality (EQ). Lastly, if \\(β_1 &lt; 0\\) and \\(β_3 &lt; 0\\), the nexus of energy consumption-environmental quality (EQ) has amplifying influence in diminishing environmental quality. Considering the magnitude, if \\(\\frac {∂EQ_{i,t}}{∂ENC_{i,t}} &gt; 0\\), energy consumption together with trade openness enhance environmental quality (EQ) but if \\(\\frac {∂EQ_{i,t}}{∂ENC_{i,t}} &lt; 0\\), both energy use and trade openness reduce the quality of environment in the sampled SSA countries."

    "section": "3.2 Estimation Technique",
    "text": "3.2 Estimation Technique\nThe unique CS-ARDL estimating technique created by Chudik et al. (2016) is the primary analytical method employed by this paper. Aspects of the Mean Group (MG) and Pool Mean Group (PMG) estimators can be incorporated into the CS-ARDL thanks to Chudik and Pesaran (2015) dynamic common correlated effects (DCCE) approach while accounting for cross-sectional dependence. It takes into consideration heterogeneous slopes, allows for small numbers of samples, concurrently analyzes both long- and short-run models, handles the problem of cross-sectional dependence, and assumes that parameters are expressed by similar characteristics. Additionally, it can be applied if the panel data is uneven and the series contains structural breaks. These are the five explanations for why we selected this estimator over others. Using the panel ARDL/PMG estimator, the validity of the CS-ARDL estimates is evaluated. Equations (2) in the panel ARDL version are expressed as;\n\\[\nΔy_{it} = w_i + δ_i (y_{i,t-1} - θ_ix_{i,t-1}) + \\Sigma_{j-1}^{p-1}ϕ_{ij} Δy_{i,t-j} + \\Sigma_{j-0}^{q-1} α_{ij} Δx_{i,t-j} + ε_{it} \\tag{5}\n\\]\nwhere \\(y_{it}\\) is environmental quality for economy i at time t; \\(α_{ij}\\) represents a matrix of the regressors (factors); \\(θ_i\\) is a connection between \\(y_{it}\\) and \\(x_{it}\\); in the long-run equilibrium, \\(δ_i\\) is the error correction term; \\(ϕ_{ij}\\) and \\(α_{ij}\\) show the connection between \\(y_{it}\\) and \\(x_{it}\\) in the short-run; and the items in the parentheses denotes in the long-run link.\nChudik et al. (2016) created the CS-ARDL model by adding cross-sectional averages to the dependent and explanatory variables, which accounts for gradient asymmetry and cross-sectional relationships. Equation (5) can be changed to be stated as its CS-ARDL equivalent, which is:\n\\[\nΔy_{it} = μ_i + δ_i(y_{i,t-1} - θ_i x_{i,t-1} + δ_i^{-1} n_i \\overline{y_t} + δ_i^{-1} φ_i \\overline{x_t}\n\\]\n\\[\n+ \\Sigma_{j-1}^{p-1}ϕ_ij Δy_{i,t-j} + \\Sigma_{j-0}^{q-1}α_ij Δx_{i,t-j}  + \\Sigma_{j-0}^{p-1}τ_{ik} Δ\\overline y_{t-j} + \\Sigma_{j-0}^{q-1}Δ_{ik} φ\\overline x_{t-j} + ε_{it} \\tag{6}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\overline{y_t}\\) and \\(\\overline{x_t}\\) are the cross-sectional averages of the cause-and-effect factors, respectively.\nWe first carried out some basic testing before applying the CS-ARDL and PMG estimators. These include the panel unit root test, slope homogeneity test, cross-sectional dependence (CD) test, and panel cointegration test. In an attempt to avoid unclear and biased estimates in panel data analysis due to differences in spatio-temporal features, and spatial effects, a CD test must be performed (J. A. Afolabi (2023); Majeed et al. (2022)). The CD test, which Pesaran (2004) first introduced, is described as:\n\\[\nCD = \\sqrt {\\frac {2T} {N(N-1)}} \\biggl (\\Sigma_{i=1}^{N-1} \\Sigma_{j=i+1}^N \\rho ij \\biggl) \\tag{7}\n\\]\nwhere, T, N and \\(ρ_{ij}\\) stand respectively for time, panel data size, and correlation coefficient. The alternative hypothesis contradicts the null hypothesis of the CD test, which claims that there is CD in the sampled nations.\nFor the dissimilarities in the demographic and economic profile of these SSA countries, it is crucial to perform the test for slope homogeneity across the cross-sectional units after the CD test. The estimations can be incoherent if slope heterogeneity is not taken into consideration J. A. Afolabi (2023); Zuo et al. (2022). As a result, this study makes use of the slope homogeneity test that Pesaran and Yamagata (2008) presented. This is how its test statistic is expressed:\n\\[\n\\tilde {Δ_{SH}} = (N) ^ \\frac{1}{2} (2K) ^  {-\\frac{1}{2}} (\\frac {1}{N}\\tilde S-k) \\tag{8}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\tilde {Δ_{ASH}} = (N) ^ \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac {2K(T-k-1)}{T+1}) ^ {-\\frac{1}{2}} (\\frac {1}{N}\\tilde S-k) \\tag{9}\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\tildeΔ_{SH}\\) and \\(\\tildeΔ_{ASH}\\) are delta tilde and adjusted delta tilde, respectively. The alternative hypothesis of the slope homogeneity test indicates that the gradients are not homogeneous in the cross-sections, contrary to the null hypothesis.\nAfter the slope homogeneity and CD testing, we conducted the panel unit root test. Pesaran and Shin (IPS) and Levin-Lin Chu are two examples of first-generation unit root approaches, but they are unable to resolve CD issues (Wu et al., 2021). We thus made use of the second-generation cross-sectional augmented CADF and IPS (CIPS), by Pesaran (2007), to establish the order of integration of each variable and account for the observed cross-sectional dependence among the sampled nations. The CIPS test statistic’s formula is:\n\\[\nCIPS = \\frac {1}{N} \\Sigma_{i=1}^nΔCA_{i,t} \\tag {10}\n\\]\n\\[\nΔCA_{i,t} = λ_i+λ_i CA_{i,t-1} + λ_i \\overline {CA_{t-1}} + \\Sigma_{l=0}^p λ_{il} Δ\\overline{CA_{t-1}} + \\Sigma_{l=0}^pλ_{il} Δ CA_{i,t-1}+μ_{it} \\tag{11}\n\\]\nwhere \\(λ_i\\), \\(CA_{i,t-1}\\), \\(Δ CA_{i,t}\\), \\(\\overline {CA_{t-1}}\\) and \\(Δ\\overline{CA_{t-1}}\\) denotes the intercept, the cross-sectional units, its, first difference, its mean values, and the cross-sectional units’ first difference, in that order.\nThe panel cointegration test is run following the panel unit root test to assess the status of the long-term linkages between the variables. In contrast to more well-known cointegration methods like Kao and Pedroni, the Westerlund test, developed by Westerlund in 2007, delivers objective results and takes CD and heterogeneity into account. The following is a list of expected test results for the Westerlund test:\n\\[\nα_i (L)Δy_{it} = δ_{1i} + δ_{2i} t + α_i (y_{it-} - β_i x_{it-1} +λ_i (L) ^ {v_{it}}) + e_{it} \\tag {12}\n\\]\nWhere \\(δ_{1i} = α_i(1)φ_{2i} - α_i φ_{1i} + α_i φ_{2i}\\) and \\(δ_{2i} = -α_i φ_{2i}\\), \\(β_i\\) is the EC coefficient and \\(α_i\\) is the path in which the regressor and regressand cointegrate."

    "text": "4.1 Preliminary Analysis\nThe full sample (the total of the two groups), middle-income countries (MICs), and low-income countries (LICs) are all represented by descriptive statistics in Table 2, as well as the important variables of interest. Although it averaged about 33.17% across the entire sample, it demonstrates that energy use is higher in MICs than in LICs, as expected. This directly correlates with economic activity as represented by RGDP, where the average, minimum, and maximum values of real GDP are higher in MICs than LICs despite having fewer observations. The relatively higher real GDP in MICs in conjunction with higher energy consumption leads to higher carbon emissions in the MICs than in LICs with 73,983 kt and 24,773 kt respectively. This is a pointer that LICs are likely to be faced with less environmental challenges associated with energy use than the MICs, all things being equal. Similarly, the Sub-Saharan African economies are somewhat trade opened economies with about 63% but MICs seem to be more opened to international trade with 78% than LICs with 52%. In general, regulatory quality seems to be low in SSA but with higher average in the MICs than in LICs with 36.35% and 21.03% respectively. Finally, gross capital formation on the continent appears to be largely low but with higher value in the MICs than the LICs, this is obvious evidence for higher productive activities in the MICs with the likely implication on environmental quality. Each variable’s standard deviation, however, is rather constant, indicating that the variables are not particularly volatile.\n\n## Warning: The following named parsers don't match the column names: Variables\n\n\nDescriptive StatisticsVariableObsMeanStd.

    "text": "4.7 Presentation and discussion of empirical results\nIn light of the findings from the preliminary tests, the CS-ARDL model is expected to shed more light on the connection between energy use and the quality of the environment in Sub-Saharan Africa (Model A) and assess the mitigating impact of trade openness in lessening the influence (Model B). The results of the analysis, which was conducted on three panels (the complete sample, low-income countries (LICs), and medium-income countries (MICs), are shown in Table 8. The long-run outcomes are provided following the short-run estimations, which are displayed in the top half of the Table.\nAccording to Model A’s findings, energy use, regardless of the temporal dimension, has a favorable influence on emissions of carbon in both LICS and MICs. The positive effect demonstrates that as energy consumption rises, environmental degradation occurs in both LICs and MICs, but it is only substantial in the case of MICs. This suggests that increased energy use for industrial purposes causes a rise in carbon emissions, which enables both short- and long-term damage of the environment. Additionally, both in the short- and long-term, Model A shows positive elasticities between carbon emission (\\(CO_2\\)) and RGDP as well as GCI in the chosen African countries, which is empirical proof of growing industrial activity in these countries. Empirically, this result is consistent with those made by Baz et al. (2020), Mesagan & Olunkwa (2020), Adejumo (2019), and Salahuddin & Gow (2019), who found that energy usage promotes environmental degradation in Pakistan, Africa, Nigeria, and Qatar, respectively. The outcome emphasizes the trade-off between energy use and environmental quality in Sub-Saharan Africa’s middle-income and low-income nations.\n\n\n\nEmpirical Analysis Model AModel BFull SampleLow-IncomeMiddle IncomeFull SampleLow-IncomeMiddle IncomeD.lnCO2CoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientECT-1.35(0.039)*-1.345(0.06)*-1.27(0.069)*-1.418(0.047)*-1.422(0.092)*-1.355(0.069)*Short Run Est.Short Run Est.lnCO2(-1)-0.35(0.039)*-0.345(0.06)*-1.27(0.069)*-0.418(0.047)*-0.422(0.092)*-0.355(0.069)*LnRGDP0.168'(0.104)0.168(0.124)0.204(0.132)0.413(0.139)-0.006(0.108)0.296(0.101)*LnENC41.313(49.937)37.524(59.68)0.68(0.34) **96.70(84.40)302.1(220.3)-5.809(2.262)**LnGCI0.007 (0.037)0.03(0.028)-0.05(0.046)-0.045(0.053)0.004(0.035)-0.126(0.058)**REQ-0.003(0.002)0.001(0.001)0.004(0.003)-0.003(0.001)0.001(0.001)-0.006(0.004)*LnTOP92.81(63.99)194.7(145.8)-5.539(1.953)*lnENC_TOP-29.07(20.84)-53.66(44.35)1.499(0.56)*Long Run Est.Long Run Est.REQ-0.002(0.001) ***0.001(0.001)-0.003(0.002)-0.002(0.001)0.001(0.001)-0.004(0.003)LnENC31.504(38.116)21.42(40.36)0.52(0.252) **67.01(62.09)189.8(135.6)-5.113(2.082)**LnGCI0.006(0.028)0.018(0.02)-0.031(0.038)-0.039(0.039)0.010(0.035)-0.095(0.049)***LnRGDP0.127(0.081)0.129(0.108)0.131(0.103)0.107(0.101)-0.218(0.279)0.221(0.070)*LnTOP65.38(46.84)132.7(92.39)-4.682(1.653)*lnENC_TOP-20.81(15.65)-37.28(28.58)1.307(0.514)**DiagnosticsDiagnosticsObs805460345805460345Groups352015352015RMSE0.070.050.080.080.050.09CD Statistic2.80.42-0.381.23-0.4120.79P-value0.00510.67590.70130.21960.67920.4309\n\n\nThe importation of more energy-efficient technology, however, has the ability to partially offset the harm that energy usage does to the environment, according to empirical studies (Kahia et al. 2019, Kashem, 2017). Consequently, energy consumption variable and the trade openness variable interacted, and the outcome (given in Model B) is addressed here. Precisely, in the LICS, the result shows that trade openness increases the rate of carbon emission which indirectly deteriorates the environment while in MICs, trade is found to reduce the rate of carbon emissions which thus promotes the quality of the environment. Examining its moderating role on the nexus between energy consumption and environmental quality, in MICs, trade is found to significantly dampen the influence of energy use on the degree of carbon emission which therefore facilitates environmental quality both in the short and long runs whereas, in the case of LICs, the reverse is the case. Trade openness worsens environmental degradation. This shows that utilizing global trade to import energy-efficient technologies, particularly in MICs, may be a viable method of raising environmental standards in Sub-Saharan African nations. The result corroborates the findings of Thuy and Nguyen (2022), and Ike et al. (2020) in developing economies and G-7 countries, respectively that trade openness dampens the consequence of \\(CO_2\\) emissions on the damage of the environment. This implies that in promoting environmental sustainability firms in industrial/manufacturing sector must be compelled to import largely environmental-friendly technologies in their production activities.\nFurthermore, the results show that real GDP, a measure of economic expansion, has a considerable short- and long-term impact on degradation of the environment in SSA’s LICs and MICs. This outcome is conceivable given that rising economic activity increases energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, which reduces environmental quality. The persistent economic expansion that SSA nations experienced, especially in the first ten years of the twenty-first century, could be blamed for the pollution- and emission-producing effects of economic growth (World Bank, 2018). Additionally, it might be linked to the countries’ expanding efforts to industrialize and diversify their economies, which have significantly boosted the magnitude of economic activities in all markets J. Afolabi and Ogunjimi (2020). Due to the growing number of economic activities that have a negative impact on the environment and the natural environment, the environment is frequently the victim of these economic activities. If not immediately handled, it might make Sub-Saharan Africa’s environmental issues even worse. According to J. A. Afolabi (2023), and Zuo et al. (2022), this finding follows theoretical predictions and the views of these researchers.\nLikewise, there is a link between big capital expenditures and energy use that is both positive and significant, although it only applies to MICs in the short- and-long terms. This demonstrates how Sub-Saharan Africa’s growing investment money promotes environmental deterioration. This study contradicts the findings of Wu et al. (2021) and Awosusi et al. (2022), who discovered that, in Uruguay and the MENA region, respectively, trade openness exacerbated damage to the environment. However, the finding shows that degradation of the environment in SSA, and especially in the MICs on the continent, is a trade-off for the pursuit of economic expansion that drives increasing capital investment. Regardless of the time dimension, it was discovered that environmental regulation quality was inversely connected to carbon emission primarily in whole sample and MICs. This shows that passing and putting into practice suitable environmental laws has a noticeable influence on reducing carbon emissions and enhancing environmental quality. It is obvious that everyone in sub-Saharan Africa needs to adopt and adhere by laws and regulations that are more environmentally friendly, including greening Hassan, Xia, and Lee (2020). Not to mention, the error correction terms imply that the pace of recovery from a shock to a long-run equilibrium across economies is somewhat slow.\nIn panel data analysis, there are a variety of estimating issues that could compromise the accuracy of the results. Therefore, doing robustness checks is essential. In this case, the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator is used. Table 8 presents the findings. The short-run and long-run coefficients of energy usage indicate that energy use is a highly significant and escalating function of carbon emissions in MICS. This suggests that using energy degrades the environment in MICs. In contrast, energy use in LICs shows a negligible long-and-short terms relationship with carbon emissions. In other words, energy use does improve environmental quality in LICS. According to this finding, MIC economies in Sub-Saharan Africa utilize energy more intensively than LIC economies do. The conclusion demonstrated that trade openness plays a substantial role in moderating the influence of energy use on the environmental quality, especially in MICs. Considering the role of trade in mitigating the unfavorable influence of energy usage on carbon emissions. This demonstrates that environmental sustainability must be achieved in each evaluated country. it is necessary to encourage the importation of environmentally favorable technologies from advanced economies.\n\n\n\nRobustness Check Model AModel BFull SampleLow-IncomeMiddle IncomeFull SampleLow-IncomeMiddle IncomeD.lnCO2CoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientCoefficientECT-0.234(0.043)*-0.197(0.060)*-0.239(0.065)*-0.207(0.042)*-0.198(0.06)*-0.217(0.071)*Constant0.767(0.215)*0.414(0.640)0.795(0.239)*0.813(0.356)**0.193(0.637)2.389(0.798)*D.lnRGDP0.335(0.0960*0.246(0.084)*0.478(0.191)*0.317(0.113)*0.175(0.103)***0.509(0.207)**D.lnENC-23.88(25.99)-53.13(52.54)0.238(0.235)307.51(310.5)-60.74(52.29)5.902(3.508)***D.lnGCI0.024(0.023)0.021(0.0200.024(0.047)0.015(0.023)0.008(0.016)0.11(0.048)D.REQ-0.001(0.000)-0.001(0.001)-0.001(0.001)-0.001(0.000)**-0.001(0.001)-0.001(0.001)D.lnTOP315.54(277.8)D.lnENC_TOP-93.29(84.95)0.014(0.011)-1.295(0.781)***Long Run Est.Long Run Est.REQ0.002(0.001)***0.005(0.002)*0.003(0.002)0.004(0.001)*0.005(0.001)*0.005(0.001)*lnENC0.039(0.006)*-0.047(0.043)0.032(0.019)-0.417(0.123)*-0.210(0.068)*-1.310(0.371)*lnGCI0.009(0.012)0.011(0.014)0.048(0.03)0.005(0.01)0.005(0.013)0.083(0.028)*lnRGDP0.261(0.017)*0.234(0.040)*0.273(0.026)*0.257(0.023)*0.284(0.039)*0.159(0.034)*lnTOP-0.275(0.089)*lnENC_TOP0.101(0.028)*0.030(0,011)*0.305(0.083)*DiagnosticsDiagnosticsObs840480360840480360Groups352015352015Log Likelihood1572.28905.5667.381633.8922.9689.8\n\n\nTheoretically, an increase in real GDP should result in higher carbon emissions for all three panes. Amazingly, the parameters of real GDP in all three partitions are statistically substantial, indicating that real GDP is a major factor in MICs and LICs in Sub-Saharan African nations when it comes to carbon emissions. This demonstrates that economic growth is linked to environmental deterioration in Sub-Saharan Africa; as a result, strong trade policy is required to reduce the rising levels of carbon emissions and other GHGs in the SSA nations. The findings on the impact of gross capital investment on carbon emissions are similar, and they support theoretical predictions by showing that higher capital investment exacerbates environmental degradation in both MICs and LICs. The outcome also provides resounding proof of how much regulatory quality slows down environmental degradation across the three panels, especially in the short term, which points to the necessity of appropriate environmental regulations to support environmental sustainability in the area. After a short-term shock, the algorithm returns to long-run equilibrium somewhat slowly. The PMG estimator’s overall results are comparable to the CS-ARDL framework results, indicating that the estimates are stable and valid for use in policymaking."

    "section": "2.4 Empirical Review and Value Addition",
    "text": "2.4 Empirical Review and Value Addition\nThe review of the existing empirical studies on the nexus between non-oil exports and economic growth in Nigeria reveals that there is a prevailing consensus among researchers that non-oil exports have a positive impact on the country’s economic growth. However, these studies relied on aggregated non-oil export datasets, and as such, the sector-specific impact of non-oil exports on Nigerian economic growth has not been examined. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the sectoral (manufactured, agricultural, solid mineral, and raw material) impact of non-oil exports on Nigeria’s economic growth using quarterly datasets from 2016 to 2020. This examination is necessary to verify whether the consensus among scholars that exports increase growth holds for the sectors included in the study.\nExisting empirical studies can be categorized into two types. The first strand focuses on investigating the relationship between non-oil exports and Nigerian economic growth, while the second focuses on identifying the determinants of Nigerian non-oil exports. Within the first strand, various studies such as Vincent (2017), Sajo and Li (2017), Kromtit et al. (2017), Anthony-Orji et al. (2017), Bolaji, Oluwaseyi Adedayo, and Y Olorunfemi (2018), Tonuchi and Onyebuchi (2019), and Osabohien et al. (2019) utilized time-series econometrics techniques (OLS, ARDL, VEC, and Granger causality) to explore the impact of non-oil exports on Nigeria’s economic growth. Their findings consistently support the export-led growth hypothesis, demonstrating that non-oil exports play a positive role in contributing to Nigeria’s economic growth during the period studied. A study in this strand that bears a resemblance to our study is that of Awoke, Awoke, and Obaji (2019) which examined the impact of agriculture and manufacturing sectors on economic growth in Nigeria. However, this study made use of agriculture and manufacturing output (in contrast to agriculture and manufacturing exports used in our study) as regressors, and thus examined the relationships between sectoral outputs and Nigeria’s economic growth rather than sectoral exports and growth.\nThe second strand encompasses the empirical research conducted by Musibau et al. (2017), Alimi (2017), Okechukwu, De Vita, and Luo (2018), Alegwu, Aye, and Asogwa (2018) and Beecroft et al. (2020) These studies specifically focus on exploring the determinants of non-oil exports in Nigeria by employing various regressors, such as exchange rate, foreign direct investment, and globalization, among others. The outcomes of these studies vary owing to the diverse methodologies and variables employed."

Due to the fact that non-oil sectoral export data sets are limited to 2016-2021, we thus consider quarterly data sets to increase the time frame and estimation precision. The GDP at 2010 constant prices and real effective exchange rate data sets were sourced from the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Statistical Bulletin-Real Sector (2022) and the NBS Statistical Bulletin-External Sector (2022) respectively. The export and import data sets were sourced from the NBS Foreign Trade Statistics (2017 & 2021).\nTo analyze the data sourced the study thus made use of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) Model, and the justification for employing the ARDL is based on the unit-root test result presented in Table 4.1.1. This study made use of STATA 13 econometrics software to carry out the estimation and numerous tests."

Also, we suggested a logarithmic form of the model in the equations above to allow us to interpret the coefficients as elasticity. The ARDL econometric form of equation 3.1 is thus stated as follows\n\\[\n\\Delta LNGDP = \\beta_0 +\\delta_1ECM_{t-i}+\\sum^{k1} _ {i=1} \\gamma_i \\Delta LNGDP_{t-i} + \\sum^{k2} _ {i=0} \\Phi_i \\Delta LNNEXP_{t-i} +\n\\] \\[\n\\sum^{k3} _ {i=0} \\Omega_i \\Delta LNTOP_{t-i} + \\sum^{k4} _ {i=0} \\eta_i \\Delta LNEXR_{t-i} + \\lambda_1 LNGDP_{t-i} +  \\lambda_2\n\\] \\[\nLNNEXP_{t-i} + \\lambda_3 LNTOP_{t-i} + \\lambda_4 LNEXR_{t-i} + \\epsilon_i          {\\tag{3.2}}\n\\]\nThe first part (i.e.,\\(Υ_i\\),\\(ϕ_i\\),\\(Ω_i\\) and \\(η_i\\) ) of equation 3.2 represents the short-run dynamics while \\(λ_1-λ_4\\) is the long-run dynamics. The \\(∂_1 ECM_(t-i)\\)is the error correction term and it measures the speed of adjustment if there is long-run disequilibrium, t stands for time, $β_0 $ is the intercept and E_t is the error term. Our main variable of interest is the coefficients of \\(LNNEXP_(t-i)\\) (i.e., \\(ϕ_i\\) and \\(λ_2\\)) which will be obtained by estimating model 3.2. Each model will be estimated by switching to a non-oil sector export variable (i.e., manufactured, agricultural, solid mineral and raw material export)."

However, these positive impacts were only found to be significant for raw material exports (lnrmexp). In other words, the positive effect of increased manufactured, agricultural, and solid mineral exports from 2016 to 2021 did not result in a substantial rise in the country’s economic growth. However, raw material exports contributed substantially to economic growth during this period. Furthermore, the elasticity coefficients of the log of manufactured export (lnmnexp) and the log of agricultural export (lnagexp) were shown to be lower than those of solid mineral export (lnsmexp) and raw material export (lnrmexp). This implies that the economic growth benefit derived from manufactured and agricultural exports was comparatively lower during 2016-2021, despite numerous efforts towards improving the sector’s outputs and competitiveness. In addition, the log of trade openness (lntop) and real effective exchange rate (lnrexr) were found to be significantly positive and negative, respectively. This implies that a substantial economic growth benefit was derived from trade openness during the period studied. However, the increase in the real effective exchange rate hindered the country’s economic growth during the same period. The short-run estimates of the coefficients of elasticity for all non-oil sector exports included in the models were all negative and insignificant. Although the short-run estimates are not our main focus in this study, the negative coefficients could be due to the fact that the short run is typically a period of learning characterized by a narrow export portfolio and higher production costs. Economies often begin to reap the benefits of their exports when they achieve economies of scale."

The underlying mechanism is the matching of capital and skills in the capital market through interaction of the required rate of return on capital, the distribution of skills in the population, and the mechanism shifting the skill distribution. The model shows that the stylized observation is driven by a particular matching rule, rather than the general rule, and is not necessarily a manifestation of disequilibrium.

    "section": "1.2 Justification of the Study",
    "text": "1.2 Justification of the Study\nIn two key areas, the study is anticipated to add to the body of knowledge on healthcare policy evaluation. First off, the study’s use of CGE modeling to assess healthcare financing reforms in Nigeria represents a shift away from a restricted internal focus on the health sector and toward broader national implications. The macroeconomic evaluation of the effects of health policy in Nigeria has hardly ever employed the static model with highly decomposed sectors, households, and labor. Therefore, it is intended that the model will explicitly detail the potential effects of the healthcare financing policies on the macroeconomic indicators, the structure of the economy, and the decline in poverty rates.\nSecond, because the study is being conducted in a developing nation, there are lessons to be learned about the overall macroeconomic effects of healthcare reform policies for low- and middle-income nations. To my knowledge, only (Kabajulizi, 2016, and Rutten (2004)) have explicitly modeled the effects of healthcare policy on the entire economy using dynamic and static computable general equilibrium models, respectively. While the study by Kabajulizi, 2016 , was conducted in Nigeria, where the economic effects of healthcare policy changes are likely to be similar to those of Nigeria, the study by Rutten (2004) was conducted in the United Kingdom, where the economic effects of healthcare policy changes are likely to differ from those of developing countries. For instance, Nigeria’s informal economy employs a sizable number of people. The Nigerian model aims to represent the effects of the informal sector on the wage structure, the sector output mix, and poverty rates in the nation."

    "section": "2.1 Empirical Literature Review",
    "text": "2.1 Empirical Literature Review\nNitesh, John & Mitu (2013) attempted Modeling Health in a CGE Framework using India as a case study in their paper for the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP). This study simulated the consequences of full tariff liberalization in the presence, partial withdrawal, and absence of health subsidies using a CGE framework. This study’s main finding is that full health subsidies minimize overall inequity by giving rural households an advantage over urban ones. Withholding health benefits causes domestic poverty to be redistributed, driving down wages in the agriculture sector, the main source of income for rural people. In this approach, health is viewed as a type of human capital that is the subject of a household’s choice function. Thus, this paper is an early attempt to include health in a framework of general equilibrium. Health is viewed as an investment good in this paradigm. It implies that, on the one hand, households decide to buy medications and medical care (i.e., invest in health) because they result in a certain increase in productivity. Businesses reward this increased production by paying healthy workers more in the job market. However, this investment in health also entails a direct cost (such as the price of medications or fees for medical consultations) that is either fully covered by the household, fully covered by the government, or (probably the most likely scenario) paid in part by households and partially by the government.\nFor the EU countries, Inge & Denise (2003) used CGE analysis to model the health-related advantages of environmental policies and their feedback effects. This research examines the significance of the feedback effects of the health-related advantages of an environmental policy using GEM-E3, a computable general equilibrium model for the EU countries. Three possible pathways for feedback are allowed by the modeling framework used in GEM-E3: a decline in medical costs, an increase in consumers’ free time, and an increase in labor productivity in the manufacturing sectors. The findings demonstrate that a more accurate assessment of the effects of environmental regulations on private consumption and employment may be made through the explicit modeling of the health-related effects of air pollution on consumers and producers. The effects of the feedback, however, are minimal when compared to the typical GEM-E3 model, where the health-related advantages are assessed ex-post.\nA recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated from a health-focused Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) was used by Judith Kabajulizi (2016) in her research paper Macroeconomic implications of Healthcare Financing reforms: a computable general equilibrium analysis of Nigeria to evaluate the effects of healthcare financing reform policies. The prioritizing of the health sector, earmarked taxes for health, and aid for health are examined as three sources of budgetary space for health. Results indicated that increasing funding for the health sector from any of the three sources of fiscal space for health, along with anticipated improvements in population health, leads to faster GDP growth rates and lower levels of poverty. While the aid for health strategy led to the greatest reduction in poverty, the tax for health policy produced the highest GDP growth rates. To fulfill the goals of the Nigeria Vision 2040, the government needs therefore enhance funding for the health sector. The following four categories can be used to group the key lessons for developing and implementing CGE in the fields of health and healthcare. To properly reflect the delayed effects of changes in health and healthcare policy on the economy, the model must first be dynamic. Second, to reflect the distinctive nature (in terms of skill composition) of the healthcare sector labor and to capture the response of various labor types to changes in health status, labor should be decomposed by skill level in the factor markets. Thirdly, because resource claims on the health sector vary depending on the type of care, the SAM’s health sector account should be broken down to reflect the study topic, such as by levels of care or treatments. Fourth, as much as the data allow, the household sector should be segmented into relatively homogenous categories in order to properly assess the welfare impact of a particular healthcare policy. The purpose of this study is to fill in research gaps by creating a dynamic CGE model for Nigeria calibrated using a social accounting matrix that is centered on the health sector but is disaggregated, as well as to report the effects of healthcare finance reforms on the entire economy."

    "text": "2.2 Theoretical Review.\nThe Walrasian General Economic Equilibrium theory, which views the economy as a collection of individuals interacting in many markets for an equal number of commodities under a specific set of baseline endowments and income distribution, is where the unique characteristics of general equilibrium modeling originate. Each agent in this situation determines his or her own supply or demand behavior by maximizing his or her own utility, profit, or cost goals.\nAccording to the Arrow-Debreau theorem, the economy is made up of a group of agents, providers and demanders, who engage in trade on a number of markets for an equal number of goods. Each agent in this situation is a price taker since the market, not the agent, determines the prices. By maximizing his own utility, profit, or cost objectives, each agent defines his own supply or demand behavior. The Arrow-Debreau theorem simply asserts that there exists a set of prices that, under general circumstances, bring supply and demand quantities into equilibrium and satisfy each agent individually. It has been established that a discrete equation with a double-singular structure has a solution by applying the Brouwer and Kakutani fixed point theorem to the problem.\nIn that it implements a kind of iterative process around a fixed point where the equilibrium vector of prices sits, the Brouwer and Kakutani theorem is constructive. The aforementioned theory was transformed into an operational model via the computed general equilibrium (CGE) model, which was later applied to dynamic analysis as well."

    "section": "4.3 Analytical/Theoretical Framework",
    "text": "4.3 Analytical/Theoretical Framework\nIn this study, the model includes exogenous factors that represent the effects of healthcare on labor outcomes. Despite the fact that this is the case, it is still important to understand the household labor supply model that underpins the connection between effective labor supplies and healthcare in the economy. The household labor supply model specifies the following relationship between healthcare and employment outcomes:\n\\(L=L(H,X, \\theta)\\)\n\\(H = H(HC)\\)\nwhere \\(L\\) represents labour outcomes (which may be labour participation rates or labour productivity rates), \\(H\\) is the health status of an individual, itself a function of a health composite \\(HC\\), \\(X\\) are observable household characteristics that affect productivity and \\(\\theta\\) are other unobservable household characteristics that may affect labour outcomes.\nIt was established in the literature review section that the elasticity of the economy’s effective labour endowments would depend on the actual percentage of the labor force waiting to be treated, the elasticity of the labor force waiting to be treated, and changes in healthcare output. This was based on the theoretical model of production equilibrium that was extended to health and healthcare. It is acknowledged from the healthcare perspective that the availability of skilled labor depends on both the quantity and the quality (efficacy) of healthcare. Assuming that households are uniformly afflicted by illness so that the number of un-well labourers is the same across households, the proportion of labourers unable to work (non-participation rate) can be defined by a constant elasticity function of a healthcare composite:\n\\(\\beta_{fel}= \\beta_{0f}HC^{- \\epsilon_f}_f\\)\nwhere \\(\\beta_{f\\epsilon l}\\) represents the non-participation rate for labour \\(l\\), \\(\\epsilon_{f\\epsilon l}\\) is a waiting list elasticity parameter and \\(\\beta_{of\\epsilon l} &gt; 0\\) is a scale parameter which is calibrated so that \\(\\beta_{f\\epsilon l} &lt; 1\\). This specification suggests that increasing healthcare will increase treatments and curing of the sick and eventually lead to a reduction in the labour non-participation rate. Therefore, as \\(HC_f\\) tends to infinity the non-participation rate tends to zero. When the healthcare provision is undertaken by both government and the private healthcare sector, the health status of the labour force is determined by a health composite of private and public healthcare. The health composite is given by the formulation:\n\\(HC_t = (C_{Hg})^{\\rho l} (C_{Hng}^{(l-\\rho l)})\\)\nwhere \\(HCl\\) is a healthcare composite for labour \\(l\\), \\(CHg\\) and \\(CHng\\) are government and non-government healthcare consumption respectively, for labour \\(l\\), and 0 ≤ \\(pl\\) ≤ 1 is the share of government healthcare in the health status of labour \\(l\\) .\nIn order to determine the impact of healthcare on labour outcomes using the formulation above, data on three important parameters is required: the share of public and private healthcare consumption in the health status of the different labour categories, \\(pl\\), the waiting list elasticity parameter \\(\\epsilon f\\), and a basis for calibrating the scale parameter . This suggests that the impact of a healthcare financing reform policy which generates health outcomes that impact on the household labour supply module could be more precisely captured, if data on the effectiveness of healthcare were available.\nGiven that policy guidance is often required even for those settings where data is scarce, such as Nigeria; this study undertakes to model the health effects as exogenous parameters. The envisaged healthcare effects of increased public health expenditure are modelled as growth in labour supply, labour productivity and total factor productivity. The health effects considered enter the model exogenously and the parameter values for the health effects shall be obtained from literature on health and economic growth."

    "section": "4.4 Estimation Technique",
    "text": "4.4 Estimation Technique\nThe dynamic CGE model used for this study specifically models the health sector as being divided into non-government healthcare, government primary healthcare, and government other healthcare. Using conventional CGE technology, the disaggregated health sector is linked to the rest of the economy to forecast the consequences of healthcare financing reforms. The International Food and Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)’s neoclassical standard CGE model, which was described in Lofgren et al., 2002 serves as its foundation.\nThe widely utilized CGE model is a currently used analytical technique created by other academics. The model will specifically be modified in the following ways to fit the Nigerian economy. The Nigeria SAM will first be revised and balanced, with the health sector account being divided into three new health accounts. Second, the newly formed health sector accounts and any associated activity, commodity, factor, and institutional accounts in the SAM must be incorporated into the model equations for production, consumption, and factors of production for the health sector. Included in this is a description of the necessary equation updates to reflect the scenarios analysis. Third, the model closing guidelines were created to address the study’s questions.\nFor the following reasons, the static model is appropriate for assessing the economic effects of changes to health and healthcare financing policies. First, the consequences of health and healthcare on the whole economy could take time to manifest. For instance, there is data that points to the benefits of early childhood health on cognitive and physical growth, which affects adult productivity. The static model’s updating equations for labor force and productivity growth allow for the capture of the short-term effects of population health status on labor supply and productivity across all economic sectors. Processes defining underlying development in total factor productivity across economic sectors, linked to advancements in healthcare and wellness, are also incorporated in the model.\nThe model is made to examine the most important problems with raising resources for the health sector through a range of approaches and mapping their distributed effects. It is designed to calculate how healthcare finance strategies affect different sectors of production, sector market shares, factor needs, income of various household types, and income of different labor skills. As a result, the model forecasts growth rates in GDP, private consumption, investment, exports and imports, as well as rates of poverty reduction. The model is calibrated using data from the Nigeria SAM of 2011, which was enhanced with a detailed and disaggregated health sector.\n\nReference"

Finding show that majority of FCT workers plan to become employers in five years’ time. We also find that monthly living costs, educational level (specifically possessing a national diploma or higher), gender, an individual’s employment sector, and apprenticeship experience significantly influence income levels of FCT workers. The research findings also suggest that FCT workers with a Bachelor’s degrees or higher had notable reservation wage expectations, while gender did not significantly influence reservation income expectations. Our research findings also indicate that larger childhood household sizes increase the probability of transitioning into the self-employment sector from wage/salary employment and also from self-employment to employer sector. The major policy implication of our results is the need to provide a stable environment for the growth and expansion of businesses as we see that majority of FCT workers intend to become employers or self-employed workers in five years’ time, their major motivation being in search of a better room for growth and expansion.\nKey words: multinomial logistic regression, income, Nigerian, transition\n\n\n\n\n\nWorker’s intended employment sectors and their motivations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper (preprint) in PDF format"

    "text": "Nigeria has the fastest-growing population in the world, with a current annual growth rate of 2.4% (world bank data). Globally, Nigeria is the 7th most populous country and the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. With an estimated population of 211 million in 2021 and a projected population of 396 million by 2050, further population growth is still imminent. The rapidly growing population is accompanied by increased urbanization, creating a conducive environment for spreading communicable diseases and bringing enormous pressure on health systems.\nNigeria, a low-and-middle-income country (LMIC), is one of the focal points of global population health challenges. Nigeria accounts for 27% of global malaria deaths1 and 10% of global maternal mortality. It is home to the highest prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and highest road injury rate globally, while also on record as the second-highest contributor to global HIV prevalence with its health system ranking 187 out of 197 sampled member countries of the United Nations(Okafor 2016)\nThe healthcare system which consists of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, with primary healthcare being the cornerstone, is one of the key channels for tackling these numerous global health challenges. We can view the healthcare system and these global health challenges through the lens of The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 tagged “ensuring healthy lives and well-being for all by 2030.” The SDG 3 has thirteen targets, with each target having indicators that measure its performance. These targets cut across maternal health, child health, environmental health, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, addiction, and universal health coverage. Healthcare interventions associated with these targets are embedded within the healthcare system with each constituent of the healthcare system having specific targets and interventions it caters to. However, primary healthcare (PHC) being the foundational constituent of the healthcare system, we focused on it and explored how Nigeria can harness it towards improving the healthcare system and reaching the SDG 3 targets. PHC uniquely caters to maternal and child health targets; it is the channel through which maternal and child health interventions are delivered. Hence, it is logical to use maternal and child health indicators to monitor PHC, the healthcare system as a whole, and the SDG 3 targets.\nFor the last three (3) decades, the progress of Nigeria towards reaching the maternal and child health targets has been minimal and not at the pace required to reach the 2030 goal. This slow progression reflects the poor primary healthcare in Nigeria that can be significantly improved through Private-Public Partnerships (PPP) in primary healthcare and coverage expansion of social health insurance."

(2019) and MMR expresses the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Achieving reduced maternal mortality (a low MMR) requires equitable access to maternal health care services such as antenatal, delivery, and postnatal services.\nMMR in Nigeria considerably declined from 1100 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 512 per 100,000 live births in 2018; which is approximately 5 women dying for every 1,000 live births.

(2019) . The slow decline in MMR is attributed to inequity in maternal healthcare access that is caused by factors such as patient-health worker interaction, availability of health workers and medicines, length of waiting times, and socioeconomic variables such as geographical location, education and wealth (NDHS, 2018). Access to antenatal care, delivery services, and postnatal care increased markedly among women with education, women residing in urban areas or southern regions, and women in the highest wealth quintile but was disproportionately so among women with no education, women living in rural areas or northern regions, and women in the lowest wealth quintile. Also, access to maternal health care was higher where health facilities have healthy patient-health worker interaction, adequacy of health workers and medicines, and short waiting times compared to where health facilities have unhealthy patient-health worker interactions, a shortage of health workers and medicines, and long waiting times."

    "text": "3.1 The Inadequacies of PHC in Nigeria\nDespite the invaluable role of PHC in improving health indicators and accelerating progress towards reaching the SDG 3 targets, the promotion of a functional and efficient primary health care system remains trivial to the government, policymakers, funders, and healthcare providers in Nigeria. PHC in Nigeria is marred by several inadequacies which include:(Program 2017; Okpani and Abimbola 2015)\n\nInsufficient healthcare resource allocation by government/private\nShortage and maldistribution of health workforce\nInadequately trained health workforce\nImproper location of primary health care centers\nPoor Interaction between patients and health workers\n\n\n3.1.1 Insufficient healthcare resource allocation by government/individuals\nIn Nigeria, meagre healthcare resources are allocated to primary healthcare when compared to secondary and tertiary healthcare because PHC is perceived as minimal and inexpensive healthcare. Abimbola et al. (2015), Organization et al. (2018) This brings about low-quality primary care and most people neglecting PHC facilities to seek primary care at secondary and tertiary facilities. Oyedeji and Abimbola (2014) This act of seeking primary care outside PHC facilities is inefficient because the cost of primary care at secondary and tertiary care facilities is relatively higher. Also, seeking primary care outside PHC facilities promotes inequities because indigent people especially those in rural areas will not have access to healthcare due to the high costs and inaccessibility of secondary and tertiary facilities.(Atim and Bhatnagar 2013; Merson, Black, and Mills 2011)\n\n\n3.1.2 Maldistribution and shortage of health workforce\nThe health workforce in Nigeria is unevenly distributed within the healthcare system. This is because health workers prefer to work in secondary and tertiary healthcare than in primary healthcare as a result of the poor incentives or none at all, offered to health workers in PHC facilities Abimbola et al. (2015) . This results in low recruitment and retention of primary healthcare workers, and subsequently, shortage of primary healthcare workforce, and low-quality care in primary healthcare facilities.(Program 2017)\n\n\n3.1.3 Inadequately trained health workforce\nThe public and private sectors in Nigeria are training too many hospital-based medical specialists at the expense of investing in and consolidating their primary healthcare medical workforce. This leads to a lower level of expertise among primary healthcare workers, compromised quality of primary healthcare, high levels of fatigue among the small population of primary healthcare workers, and unavailability of health services in the communities where they are needed most.(Organization et al. 2018)\n\n\n3.1.4 Improper location of primary health care centers\nThe Nigerian government does very little to control/evaluate the geographic location of public and private primary healthcare facilities. This results in allocative inefficiency which is an overprovision of primary healthcare facilities and healthcare workers in some areas while other areas (especially those in need) are not covered.(Program 2017)\n\n\n3.1.5 Poor Interaction between patients and health workers\nPatients-health workers interaction are measured by indices such as patient satisfaction, time frame for accessing health care, home-based care, interpreters, disability-friendly services, and integration of preventive care and health promotion into primary care services. Since primary healthcare services in Nigeria are not focused on the entirety of individual health needs, the performance of these indices remains poor and this hinders the goal of achieving healthcare for everyone by 2030."

    "section": "4.1 Comparing Private Health Care Delivery and Public Health Care Delivery",
    "text": "4.1 Comparing Private Health Care Delivery and Public Health Care Delivery\nThe relative performance of private health care and public health care can be measured using six health systems themes described by WHO in the 2000 World Health Report. Murray and Frenk (2001) The six themes are accessibility and responsiveness; quality; outcomes; accountability, transparency, and regulation; fairness and equity; and efficiency.\n\nAccessibility and responsiveness Accessibility and responsiveness entail availability, timeliness of service, and hospitality to patients. Majority of people in Nigeria patronize private healthcare facilities because they are often nearer, open for longer hours, have shorter wait times, Bank (2011); Brugha and Pritze-Aliassime (2003) seen as more hospitable, trusted, and dependable, Smith, Brugha, and Zwi (2001); Polsa et al. (2011) than public healthcare facilities.\nQuality of healthcare Quality of healthcare encompasses comprehensiveness of services, diagnostic accuracy, management standards, and client retention. Quality of care fluctuates in both private and public sectors. Private healthcare providers are worse in the evidence-based management of diseases. For example, in the evidence-based management of diarrhea and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria in Nigeria, private healthcare providers have poorer knowledge of correct diagnosis and treatment when compared to public healthcare providers. Notwithstanding, private health care providers are better at providing sophisticated health equipment, making drugs available, and providing quality healthcare service.\nOutcomes Outcomes refer to treatment success rates, population coverage, morbidity, and mortality. From a cross-sectional viewpoint, maternal and child health outcomes are superior in areas where private healthcare facilities dominate because of the better accessibility and responsiveness of private healthcare facilities. With states ranked according to the share of labor and delivery services provided by the private sector, the table below shows the disparity in service delivery and outcomes between the top 5 states and the bottom 5 states of the distribution\n\n\nA table showing the disparity in service delivery and outcomes between private sector serviced states in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\nPrivate Sector (%)\nInfant Mortality Rate\nUnder-5 Mortality Rate\nSkilled ANC (%)\nSkilled ANC (%)\nFull immunization (%)\n\n\n\n\nTop 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbia\n79\n55\n83\n911\n91\n34\n\n\nEnugu\n77\n-\n-\n93\n92\n51\n\n\nImo\n74\n66\n96\n96\n96\n44\n\n\nBayelsa\n73\n57\n95\n62\n38\n28\n\n\nAnambra\n71\n39\n53\n98\n97\n55\n\n\nAverage\n75\n54\n52\n88\n83\n42\n\n\nBottom 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBauchi\n32\n81\n161\n60\n22\n14\n\n\nTaraba\n29\n64\n105\n45\n30\n12\n\n\nZamfara\n28\n104\n210\n42\n16\n5\n\n\n\nThe private sector delivers an average of 75% of services in the top 5 states. In contrast, the private sector delivers only an average of 28% in the bottom 5 states. The average infant mortality rate in the top group was 55 per 1,000 live births compared to 81 per 1,000 live births in the bottom group. Likewise, the average under-5 mortality rate among the top group was 83 per 1,000 live births which is about twice less than the under-5 mortality rate of 161 per 1,000 live births for the bottom group.\nHowever, public healthcare is generally associated with better outcomes for public-interest goods such as family planning, treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and tuberculosis. While private healthcare is associated with an increase in tuberculosis incidence, and high mortality rates among young women due to unskilled fertility control services.(Basu et al. 2012)\n\nAccountability, transparency, and regulation\nThis involves data accessibility and quality, public health functions, and reform capacity. Compared to public healthcare, private healthcare is characterized by an extreme paucity of data on delivery practices and outcomes. The public sector performs better than the private sector in performing public-interest functions such as reporting cases of diseases to public health systems. The public sector is well regulated in terms of patient-care practices. Hence, the government directs resources towards assessing accreditation and quality of private healthcare to ensure patient safety\nFairness and equity\nFairness and equity entail financial barriers to care and equal distribution. Financial constraints in accessing healthcare is prevalent in both private and public healthcare. However, the financial constraints are lesser in public healthcare because of the government provision of healthcare subsidies. Private healthcare mostly caters to the needs of those with higher income. While public healthcare caters to the needs of everyone including the indigent and disadvantaged communities thereby promoting equity in the distribution of health services.\nEfficiency\nEfficiency refers to cost, redundancy, fragmentation, and delays. In Nigeria, the cost of care in the private sector is relatively higher compared to the cost of equivalent care in the public sector. This makes the public sector more cost-efficient in healthcare delivery. Fragmentation in buying and distributing medications in both sectors results in high cost of drugs, redundant treatment, and overall health costs. Delay in tuberculosis diagnosis and greater costs is closely associated with the private sector than the public sector.\n\nBeyond the six (6) health themes which highlights the disparities between private healthcare and public healthcare, data from household surveys across Nigeria show that secondary healthcare facilities (where the private sector accounts for 74% Nigeria (2018) ) are the most patronized for healthcare and dominant recipients of healthcare expenditures. Commission et al. (2019) Estimates based on NDHS 2013 show that the private healthcare delivers 54% of healthcare services nationally; and estimates from NHA 2010-2016 show that private healthcare creates 53% of the total value of healthcare services consumed in hospital/facility settings (primary, secondary and tertiary facilities plus specialized hospitals). However, when the value from other participants in the healthcare value chain 1 – providers of healthcare inputs and ancillary services – are added, the private sector share increases to 65%. The high patronage of private healthcare is closely linked to patient satisfaction. This satisfaction stems from the greater investments in and the effective management of private healthcare that result in better responsiveness, accessibility, and healthcare structures. Although patient satisfaction with private healthcare may be based on measures such as service delivery and healthcare facility structure that are irrelevant to health, however, public healthcare performs better with health-relevant measures such as evidence-based treatment and clinical expertise.\nPrimary healthcare facilities in Nigeria, which have been estimated to be 33,000 (where the private sector accounts for only 28% Nigeria (2018) ) are the least patronized for healthcare despite its relative affordability. The public sector has grossly mismanaged these primary healthcare facilities and rendered them almost non-functional. This has led to poor healthcare service delivery and underutilization of PHC facilities. People prefer to seek primary care at secondary healthcare facilities even if doing so costs more. Encouraging private-public partnerships that build on the strengths of both sectors while addressing their challenges, is expected to yield significant improvements in primary healthcare in Nigeria."

    "text": "4.2 Private-Public Partnerships (PPP) in healthcare\nPPP in healthcare is a long-term contract between public and private sectors operating as a legal entity. The public sector provides the financial resources, enumerates operational functions, and empowers private sectors to coordinate and manage delivery based on the terms of the agreement. While the private sector gets remuneration for its services and takes up significant risks of the partnership while benefiting from the virtue of shared cost savings.\nDeveloped countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands have used Private-Public healthcare to significantly improve health outcomes and speed up their progress towards reaching the SDG 3 targets. While developing countries such as South Africa, Egypt, Ghana, Botswana, Pakistan, Kenya, and Malaysia have taken a cue from developed countries and firmly adopted private-public healthcare. Okafor (2016) In Kenya, a PPP between Family Health International (FHI) 360 and the Ministry of Health reduced treatment costs, improved access to and quality of healthcare\nThe Nigerian government recognized the importance of private-public partnership in healthcare towards reaching the SDG 3 targets and to this effect, it initiated support for private-public partnership by introducing The National Policy on Private-Partnership for healthcare delivery in 2005. The key primary objectives of the policy are: to build and harness public confidence in the public and private health sectors towards reaching the SDG 3 targets; and ensure a sustainable and strengthened healthcare system. Okafor (2016) Despite the national policy on PPP for healthcare, only one out of the forty projects executed under private-public partnership in 2016, was directed at strengthening healthcare and it was still under implementation. During this time, 60 more new projects were under development, and still, only one was targeted at healthcare.(Nwankwo and PMP 2016)\nThe implementation of Private-Public partnerships in healthcare in Nigeria has been minimal due to: ineffective partnerships among different stakeholders; inadequate health financing; neglect of primary healthcare alternatives in improving access and efficiency; and low level of health promotion, advocacy, and health education. Hence, health outcomes have remained poor in the country.(Okafor 2016)"

    "text": "4.3 Private-Public partnership in PHC\nIn India, the government grants under private-public partnerships in healthcare were concentrated on PHC. Private-public partnerships strengthened India’s PHC and this improved access to maternal and child health, reduced mortalities and morbidities among women and children, ensured better quality of care, and made social health insurance work better. This in turn strengthened Private-Public healthcare and improved tuberculosis and HIV intervention outcomes.(Pal and Pal 2009)\nA study in Pakistan showed the impact of Private-Public primary healthcare on maternal and child healthcare services such as antenatal care, postnatal care, and immunization. Coverage of these services increased during the period of PPP implementation. Although baseline data were not available for postnatal care, however, data showed an increase in coverage from the PPP pioneer year (2012) to 2013.(Imtiaz et al. 2017)\n\nA table showing an increase in the coverage of maternal and child health services in Pakistan from the PPP pioneer year (2012) to 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaternal and Child Health Services\nPre-PPP (2010-2011)\nPost-PPP (2012-2013)\n\n\n\n\nAntenatal Care\n8,437 pregnant women\n11,740 pregnant women\n\n\nPostnatal Care\n2,407 (2012) women\n3,317 women\n\n\nImmunization\n12,594 children\n21,656 children\n\n\n\nLessons from India and Pakistan underscores the importance of private-public partnerships in PHC towards achieving the SDG 3 targets and improving the implementation of Private-Public healthcare. PHC is pivotal to PPP in healthcare because:\n\nPrimary Health Care is a whole-of-society approach to health and well-being by anticipating and meeting the health needs of people along the continuum of care from health promotion and protection, disease prevention and treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care to people’s everyday environment.(Organization 2021)\nPrimary healthcare has a structure that enables sustainable and adequate healthcare financing. Its structure is three-pronged and constitutes: primary care and essential public health functions; multisectoral policy and action; empowered people and communities. This structure is better adapted for the implementation of social health insurance that enables sustainable financing of quality health care and minimizes financial constraints in healthcare access. Social health insurance coupled with primary healthcare is known as Universal Health Coverage (UHC). UHC has a three-pronged focus that constitutes financial protection/reduced household expenditure on health, quality services, medicines and vaccines, and equitable access. The three (3) pronged structure of PHC coupled with social health insurance corroborates with the three (3) pronged focus of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) towards improving health care quality and reducing inequitable access caused by financial constraints and socioeconomic factors such as education.\n\n\nA table showing the relationship between UHC and social health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUHC COMPONENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphc components + SOCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE\n\nFinancial Protection/reduced householdnexpenditure on health\nQuality Services\nmedicines and vaccines\nEquitable Access\n\n\n\nPrimary\ncare and Essential public health functions\nThis component ensures financial protection/reduced household expenditure via population-level and cost-effective health services along the continuum of care vis-à-vis health promotion, disease prevention and treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care to prevent ill-health and promote well-being.\nIt provides quality, effective and standard first contact care along the continuum, that is continuous, comprehensive, coordinated, and people-centered.\nPHC emphasis on community-based services is an important way to ensure access, even in rural and remote areas, and among disadvantaged populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-sectoral policy and action\nAddresses underlying financial determinants (upstream/macro level factor) of health outcomes via advocating for health subsidies and social health insurance schemes. Thereby, reducing individual care and expenditure, preventing ill-health, and promoting well-being.\nReduces the burden of disease among the population by addressing upstream/macro-level determinants of health such as environment (e.g. raising awareness on the importance of proper sanitation and hygiene to health), government policies (e.g. encouraging the government to increase taxation on frequently abused substances like tobacco low taxation on substances like tobacco), education (e.g. educating people on positive health behaviors and outcomes) and poverty (e.g. providing cost-effective health services). Thereby, freeing resources for improving the quality and safety of health care delivery.\nIncreases appropriate access of services by reducing socioeconomic barriers to access such as community design and living conditions (e.g. bringing health care closer to people).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpowered people and communities\nAdvocacy for expanding financial protection; people involved in the design of financing systems improve acceptability and increase buy-in, which is critical for scaling interventions.\nAdvocacy for expanding access; community involvement as co-developers of services leads to the increased cultural sensitivity of health care services and patient satisfaction. It ensures more appropriate use of services and medicines and improves health literacy on vaccines and medicines. This results in better health outcomes.\nAdvocacy for not leaving anyone behind; people and communities are empowered to function as informal caregivers.\n\n\n\nSource: World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).(Organization et al. 2018)\nNigeria has also gained some momentum with private-public partnership in primary healthcare. A tuberculosis program carried out in Kaduna State in Nigeria showed the effectiveness of private-public primary healthcare in tuberculosis treatment. Treatment outcomes compared favorably to state and national figures.(Gidado, Ejembi, et al. 2009)\n\nA table showing the impact of PPP on the treatment outcomes for a tuberculosis program in Kaduna State, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\nPrivate\n\nPublic\n\nKaduna state\nNational\n\n\n\n\nDelivery\nPrimary Health Care\nSecondary Health Care\nPrimary Health Care\nSecondary Health Care\n\n\n\n\nPercentage\n70%\n30%\n60%\n40%\n\n\n\n\nTreatment success of tuberculosis\n\n\n81.3%\n\n80.4%\n81.0%\n\n\n\nAlso, a study assessing the contributions of private health facilities in a pioneer private-public partnership in childhood immunization in four (4) local government areas of Abia State in Nigeria, showed the positive impact of PPP on immunization services. Oluoha, Umeh, and Ahaneku (2014) A large number of people benefited from the immunization program.\n\nA table showing the impact of PPP on immunization in Abia State, Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Government Area\nType of Health Facility\nNumber of health facilities offering immunzation services\nTotal number immunized in 2011\n\n\n\n\nAbia North\nUmuahia North\nAba South\nOsisioma\nPrivate\n79 (45%)\n6,207 (20.80%)\n\n\n\nPublic\n96 (55%)\n23,630 (79.20%)\n\n\nTotal\n\n175 (100%)\n29,837 (100%)\n\n\n\nAdopting private-public partnerships in primary healthcare raises concerns about sustainable healthcare financing. Social health insurance, through its financial risk pooling, is one of the key ways to address these issues on the financial sustainability of private-public partnerships in PHC, towards improving health outcomes and reaching the SDG 3 targets. Also, there are concerns about healthcare affordability. Private-public partnerships in PHC only limitedly address the financial constraints associated with accessing healthcare because the financial protection offered by PHC in itself is limited; contrary to popular beliefs in Nigeria, PHC is not cheap or free healthcare. However, social health insurance has the capacity to address these financial constraints to a large extent. It is important to note that social health insurance does not reduce total health expenditure but rather reduces out-of-pocket spending by pooling financial resources."

We employed descriptive tables, Mincerian regression models, and multinomial logit regression models to analyze workers’ employment transition motivations and economic constraints. Data from a multipurpose survey carried out by Helpman Development Institute Garki 2, Abuja, which focused on employment sector choices, income levels, reservation wage expectations, fertility decisions, and insurance knowledge is used in this research endeavor. Finding show that majority of FCT workers plan to become employers in five years’ time. We also find that monthly living costs, educational level (specifically possessing a national diploma or higher), gender, an individual’s employment sector, and apprenticeship experience significantly influence income levels of FCT workers. The research findings also suggest that FCT workers with a Bachelor’s degrees or higher had notable reservation wage expectations, while gender did not significantly influence reservation income expectations. Our research findings also indicate that larger childhood household sizes increase the probability of transitioning into the self-employment sector from wage/salary employment and also from self-employment to employer sector. The major policy implication of our results is the need to provide a stable environment for the growth and expansion of businesses as we see that majority of FCT workers intend to become employers or self-employed workers in five years’ time, their major motivation being in search of a better room for growth and expansion.\nKey words: multinomial logistic regression, income, Nigerian, transition"

The reservation income for workers’ seeking to transition from wage employment to employer status (176,000) is higher than that of those seeking to move to self-employment (147,000), signifying the consciousness of individuals seeking to transition to employer status of the need to pay staff.

We also see that workers planning to remain in self-employment earn significantly more than the average self-employed worker, which is a logical decision. The mean reservation income for workers’ seeking to transition from self-employment to wage-employment status (149,000) is lower than the average self-employed workers’ reservation income (212,000), but higher than that of those seeking to become employers (144,000). Similar to the wage-employment statistics, individuals seeking to transition to employer status have longer work experience periods (49 months) that those transitioning to wage-employment (45 months). Workers planning to remain in self-employment have worked for longer than the average self-employed individual, which is further testament to their higher-than-average earnings."

In preparing the tabulation, the intended employment sector of individuals who did not plan to switch employment sector in five years was filled with their current employment status. From table 6 above, we saw that workers who were currently employer plan to remain in this employment sector for the foreseeable future while majority of individuals who are family enterprise worker plan to transition to employer status (32.43 per cent). We also see from the table that majority of the individuals who are currently self-employed plan to remain in this employment status (54.50 per cent) while the second largest group of self-employed workers plan to transition to employer status (22.52 per cent). The third group of self-employed individuals plan to transition to wage employment (20.27) while the smallest group plan to transition to family enterprises (2.70). We can also deduce from the table that majority of individuals who are currently wage/salary employed plan to remain in this employment sector (31.58 per cent), the second largest group of individuals in this employment sector plan to switch to self-employment status (31.58), the third largest group plan to become employers in five years’ time (27.19) while the smallest group plan to transition into the family enterprise sector (1.10). It was also noted from the table that majority of individuals who are currently working under a family enterprise plan to switch employment sector to being an employer status (32.43per cent), while the second largest group plan to remain in the family enterprise (24.32). The remaining family enterprise workers equally want to switch to either self-employment or a wage/salary employment in five years’ time (21.62). Investigating the individuals who are currently unemployed, majority of these individuals wants to became a wage/salary employee (52.27 per cent), the second largest group wants to become self-employed (31.82). The third group of unemployed individuals want to become an employer (13.64 per cent) while the smallest group of unemployed individuals want to work with a family enterprise (2.27). The potential employment transition models will throw more light into the motivations for these desired future changes in employment status.\n\n\n\nWorker’s intended employment sectors and their motivations\n\n\ncharacteristics of individual looking to switch employment status in five years’ time Figure1. It is observed that majority of workers plan to become employers in five years’ time with their major motivation being a need better room for growth and expansion. The second highest group of workers plan to become self-employed, their major motivation being a need for higher wage or income. The third group of workers plan to transition into wage-employment, their major reason for choosing this transition path also being the search for higher wage or income. The last group of workers plan to transition to family enterprise status but there wasn’t any discernable motivation for this switch as their motivations where evenly spread across all the options available in the questionnaire."

    "text": "5.6 Regression results\nMincerian regression results\nThe literature review has shown us that the major determinants of income, both locally and internationally, include age, sex, and educational level. The determinants of monthly income and reservation wage are further investigated with regression models using monthly income and reservation wage values from the survey. Regression results on the influence of various factors on workers’ monthly income and reservation wage are presented in table 5. The results for the monthly income model show that having longer employment durations (experience), higher monthly living costs, and possessing a national diploma or higher all significantly increase monthly income levels. We also see that working in non-wage employment (employers, self-employed, and family enterprise work) also led to increases in monthly income. As expected, we also see that being a female worker led to reductions in monthly income levels. Surprisingly, having apprenticeship experience also led to reductions in monthly income. From the monthly income model, we also notice that being married did not have a significant effect on monthly income. Moving on to the reservation wage model, we see from the results that unlike in the monthly income model, the only factors that led to increases in reservation wage expectations are monthly cost, possessing a Bachelor’s degree or higher, and being self-employed. From the results we also see that longer employment durations, possessing a national diploma or below, being married, working in a family enterprise, working as an employer, being a female worker, and having apprenticeship experience did not have a significant effect on reservation wage. We believe this is to be expected as respondents generally only considered their monthly living costs when asked the reservation wage expectation question. Regression models that explored interactions between variables such as sex, marital status, and educational level were explored, but it did not yield any noteworthy outcomes.\nTable 9\n\nMincerian regression results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIABLES\nLog Monthly Income\nLog Reservation Income\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment duration\n0.00131***\n0.000503\n\n\n\n\n(-0.000429)\n(-0.000422)\n\n\n\nLog monthly cost\n0.671***\n0.641***\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0289)\n(-0.0295)\n\n\n\nNational diploma\n0.228***\n0.00967\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0581)\n(-0.0568)\n\n\n\nBSc and above\n0.424***\n0.280***\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0515)\n(-0.0501)\n\n\n\nMarried\n0.0342\n-0.00812\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0453)\n(-0.0439)\n\n\n\nEmployer & family enterprise\n0.241***\n0.0607\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0703)\n(-0.0629)\n\n\n\nSelf employed\n0.213***\n0.117**\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0502)\n(-0.0489)\n\n\n\nFemale\n-0.120***\n-0.0705*\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0435)\n(-0.0418)\n\n\n\nApprenticeship experience\n-0.101**\n0.0188\n\n\n\n\n(-0.0411)\n(-0.0397)\n\n\n\nConstant\n3.429***\n4.495***\n\n\n\n\n(-0.307)\n(-0.312)\n\n\n\nObservations\n689\n708\n\n\n\nR-squared\n0.651\n0.564\n\n\n\n\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1\nSource: authors’ computation from survey data\nOther variables considered in the regression include; Age\n\nPotential employment transition results\nMultinomial logit models have been used to assess the likelihood of employment transition in a wide range of studies ( Guven-Lisaniler, Tuna, and Nwaka (2018); Taiwo (2013)). Using a multinomial logit model, the potential transition of workers from wage employment or self-employment, to other employment sectors was analysed by examining factors that could influence the probability of transitioning from one employment sector to another. The potential employment transitions that were focused on are; wage employment to self-employment, wage employment to employer status, self-employment to wage-employment, and self-employment to employer status. The base categories for the two transition models are those workers who chose to remain in wage/salary employment and self-employment respectively. For the wage to employer transition, we see that being married had a negative impact on the probability of this employment sector transition while having apprenticeship experience increased the likelihood of this transition occurring. For the wage/salary employment to self-employment transition, we see that larger childhood household sizes increased the probability of this transition occurring\n\nEmployment sector transition regression results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARIABLES\nWAGE TO EMPLOYER\nWAGE TO SELF\nSELF TO WAGE\nSELF TO EMPLOYER\n\n\n\n\nChildhood household\n0.0139\n0.0600**\n-0.07\n-0.105**\n\n\n\n(-0.0304)\n(-0.0297)\n(-0.0536)\n(-0.0505)\n\n\nEmployment duration\n-0.000453\n-0.00365\n0.000386\n-5.76E-05\n\n\n\n(-0.00363)\n(-0.00435)\n(-0.00453)\n(-0.00389)\n\n\nLog wage premium\n0.0408\n-0.129\n-0.336\n-0.184\n\n\n\n(-0.166)\n(-0.162)\n(-0.345)\n(-0.279)\n\n\nLog monthly income\n0.219\n-0.362\n-0.958*\n-0.827*\n\n\n\n(-0.239)\n(-0.246)\n(-0.51)\n(-0.429)\n\n\nMarried\n-0.674**\n-0.907***\n-0.0657\n0.0885\n\n\n\n(-0.289)\n(-0.29)\n(-0.663)\n(-0.532)\n\n\nApprenticeship experience\n0.630**\n0.486*\n1.188**\n0.704\n\n\n\n(-0.262)\n(-0.258)\n(-0.602)\n(-0.48)\n\n\nNational diploma\n-0.0794\n-0.737*\n0.0111\n-0.501\n\n\n\n(-0.404)\n(-0.412)\n(-0.707)\n(-0.635)\n\n\nBSc & above\n-0.209\n-0.0391\n0.377\n0.333\n\n\n\n(-0.393)\n(-0.368)\n(-0.692)\n(-0.575)\n\n\nParent’s non-wage employment\n0.392\n0.517**\n-0.0774\n-0.293\n\n\n\n(-0.262)\n(-0.258)\n(-0.598)\n(-0.49)\n\n\nFemale\n-0.114\n0.37\n-1.061\n-0.496\n\n\n\n(-0.271)\n(-0.26)\n(-0.72)\n(-0.548)\n\n\nConstant\n-3.464\n4.546*\n13.36***\n11.53***\n\n\n\n(-2.553)\n(-2.669)\n(-5.034)\n(-4.223)\n\n\nObservations\n401\n401\n134\n134\n\n\n\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses. *** p&lt;0.01, ** p&lt;0.05, * p&lt;0.1 Source: authors’ computation from survey data\nWe also see that the probability of transitioning from wage/salary employment to self-employment was also negatively impacted by being married.

    "section": "3.1 Data",
    "text": "3.1 Data\nIn the pursuit of unraveling the intricate dynamics of intended fertility, a comprehensive multi-purpose survey was conducted across 10 major towns within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria. The survey, executed from October 9th to October 24th, 2023 aimed to capture a diverse range of responses across various demographic groups. A structured questionnaire at individual level served as the primary tool for data collection. The choice of a structured questionnaire allowed for a systematic and standardized approach, ensuring consistency in data collection across the diverse sample. To ensure a robust representation of the population, a stratified sampling method was employed. Ten major towns within the FCT served as distinct strata, with samples drawn proportionally from each stratum. This approach aimed to account for potential variations in demographic characteristics and cultural nuances across different regions within the FCT.\nA total of 842 individuals were interviewed during the survey period. Trained enumerators, equipped with a clear understanding of the survey’s objectives and methodologies, administered the questionnaires. The use of trained enumerators helped maintain consistency in the delivery of questions, minimized errors in data collection, and ensured a standardized approach to participant engagement. The questionnaire covered basic demographic information, labor market information and fertility intentions. Understanding these demographic factors was deemed crucial in contextualizing fertility intentions within the broader socio-demographic landscape.\nThe decision to conduct a primary data collection survey rather than relying on secondary data sources was deliberate, driven by several advantages. Firstly, primary data collection allowed for the customization of survey instruments to align with the specific nuances of the FCT’s diverse population. Tailoring questions to the local context ensured the relevance and cultural sensitivity of the survey, addressing factors that might not be adequately captured in existing secondary data sets. Secondly, primary data collection offered the opportunity to capture real-time and context-specific information. Fertility intentions, influenced by dynamic socio-cultural and economic factors, may experience shifts over time. By conducting the survey during a specific time frame, the research aimed to capture a snapshot of intended fertility dynamics, considering temporal variations that might be crucial for a comprehensive understanding. Moreover, primary data collection facilitated the inclusion of open-ended questions, enabling respondents to express their thoughts and experiences in their own words. This qualitative dimension added richness to the data, allowing for a deeper exploration of the complexities surrounding intended fertility.\nSeveral unique aspects distinguish this survey from previous research endeavors. Firstly, the focus on 10 major towns within the FCT ensures a localized perspective, acknowledging the potential heterogeneity in fertility intentions within a specific geographical context. This geographical specificity allows for a nuanced analysis that considers regional variations, offering insights that might be overlooked in broader national surveys. The inclusion of trained enumerators also enhances the reliability of the data collected. The enumerators, equipped with a thorough understanding of the survey’s objectives, were able to address any clarifications required by participants, minimizing misunderstandings and ensuring a high level of data accuracy. Additionally, the emphasis on demographic factors, including age, gender, educational background, and income level, contributes to a holistic understanding of the context in which fertility intentions are formulated. Recognizing the interconnectedness of these demographic elements provides a comprehensive backdrop for interpreting the survey findings."

Initially, the study considered the ideal number of children as an alternative dependent variable. However, a high correlation coefficient (0.72 as shown in Table 1) between the ideal and intended number of children led to the decision to focus solely on the intended number. The strong correlation indicated that respondents’ ideal and intended family sizes were closely aligned, making it difficult to distinguish between the two in the regression analysis.\nTable 2: Descriptive statistics of all respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nObservations\nMean\nStandard Deviation\nMinimum\nMaximum\n\n\nNumber of Dependent children\n839\n0.3897\n1.0543\n0\n8\n\n\nMonthly income\n694\n131125\n287655.4\n10000\n5000000\n\n\nMonthly living cost\n838\n106387.8\n147616.6\n10000\n2000000\n\n\nKids number currently\n841\n1.1534\n1.8038\n0\n10\n\n\nNumber of intended children\n839\n4.2574\n2.4152\n0\n20\n\n\nChildhood household size\n839\n9.4219\n5.1485\n1\n40\n\n\nHours worked per week\n726\n51.0048\n21.5859\n0\n140\n\n\n\nApproximately 18% of respondents reported having at least one foster child living with them.

About 37% of respondents grew up in childhood households with more than 10 individuals. The experience of growing up in larger households could potentially shape individuals’ fertility intentions.\nTable 3: Descriptive statistics by gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMALE\n\n\nFEMALE\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nObs.\nMean\nStandard deviation\nObs.\nMean\nStandard deviation\n\n\nHour worked per week\n469\n53.0954\n23.3490\n257\n53.0954\n17.3299\n\n\nMonthly income\n453\n155465.8\n348712.7\n241\n155465.8\n81812.58\n\n\nMonthly living cost\n541\n116376.2\n173335.9\n297\n116376.2\n79312.78\n\n\nNumber of intended children\n542\n4.6015\n2.6828\n297\n4.6015\n1.6576\n\n\nNumber of dependent children\n542\n0.4908\n1.2095\n297\n0.4908\n0.6485\n\n\nKids number currently\n544\n1.2629\n1.8762\n297\n1.2629\n1.6474\n\n\nChildhood household size\n542\n9.8432\n5.6244\n297\n9.8432\n4.0384\n\n\nCurrent household size\n545\n4.2459\n3.0126\n297\n4.2459\n2.7867\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly income/living cost by gender in FCT\n\n\nThe descriptive statistics in Table 3 offer valuable insights into the gender-specific dynamics of factors influencing fertility intentions.

The potential financial success of entrepreneurship can positively impact fertility intentions, but it may also introduce complexities in managing time and responsibilities. Self-employed individuals and employers may experience unique challenges in balancing the demands of entrepreneurship with family aspirations. Addressing challenges related to work-life balance, income disparities, and the unique circumstances of different employment categories can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing fertility intentions in diverse socio-economic contexts.\nTo ensure a comprehensive analysis, several control variables such as gender, marital status, education level, age and religion were included in the regression model. A binary variable (1 for female, 0 for male) was used to account for potential gender-related differences, while a categorical variable accounting for single, married, divorced, or widowed respondents was used in the aspect of marital status.\nFor married individuals, an additional control variable, the current number of children, was introduced in the regression analysis. The current number of children which is the summation of an individual’s biological children and adopted children, helped to provide insights into the existing family structure."

    "text": "ABSTRACT\nUsing a comprehensive household survey data on living conditions in Nigeria, the authors examined the impact of safety net measures (cash assistance, food assistance, in-kind assistance and scholarship) on household outcomes (consumption level and level of education). Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), households were classified into different wealth level category to know the wealth level of households that received the safety net measures and to know if the targeting was effective. The estimate show very effective targeting in urban areas compared to rural areas. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was employed to determine the impact of safety net measures on household outcomes. The findings show evidence that cash and food assistance improves the consumption level of households and that scholarship improves attendance of school age children in school, while suggesting that the targeting mechanism should be looked into in order to get safety net measures to households that will benefit the most from it the most specifically in rural areas\nKey words: safety net, household outcomes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Propensity Score Matching (PSM)"

    "text": "4.1 Question 1: Which households get what?\nWe employed PCA using the asset section included in the study. Households were asked: Does your household own any [item]? and How many [item] does your household own? Options available for item include but not limited to: furniture, gas cooker, fridge, mattress, air conditioner, washing machine, bicycle, generator, computer, and microwave. For the safety net section, households were asked: Any member received any assistance from institution in form of [safety net]? Options for safety net include cash assistance, food assistance, in-kind assistance, and scholarship. Institution includes the different programme through which households can receive safety net. They include YouWin, Input-For-Work Programme (FADAMA), E-Wallet Input Subsidy Programme, Growth Enhancement Scheme (GES), School Feeding Programme, N-Power, Other Federal Government Schemes (Not listed above), State Government, Local Government, International Organisation, Religious Body, NGO, and Others.\nWe present estimate for each of the safety net measures. We also show estimates by sector, i.e. separately for urban and rural households. We begin by looking at the cash transfer estimate percentage summarized in the tables below (Figure 1). It is observed that in urban areas, households that are very poor (4.95 per cent) receive the most through cash assistance followed by poor households (2.62 per cent) with the least being average households (1.72 per cent). The difference between the average households (1.72 per cent), rich households (1.74 per cent) and very rich households (1.75 per cent) is 0.02 per cent and 0.01 per cent respectively. This reflects a fair target to households that are very poor in urban areas. From the table, we see that in rural areas there was barely any significant difference in the percentage of households that received cash assistance across all wealth levels. The difference between the average households (2.09 per cent), very rich households (1.99 per cent), and rich households (1.83 per cent) is 0.1 per cent and 0.16 per cent respectively. Average households (2.09 per cent) received the most from cash assistance, followed by very rich households (1.99 per cent). Though one factor that could have led to this will be that there were more rural households in the sample, the minute differences reflect unevenness in the effectiveness of the targeting mechanism used in rural areas.\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of cash assistance estimate by sector\n\n\n\nEvaluating the percentage of food subsidies in figure 2, the findings in urban areas are in line with we see in urban areas for cash assistance estimates. As expected, the food assistance in urban areas were evenly targeted with very poor households (18.32 per cent) receiving the most, followed by poor households (14.46 per cent), average households (8.80 per cent), rich households (7.85 per cent), and very rich households (3.62 per cent). Still, average households (2.09 per cent) received the most from food assistance in rural areas. This finding also reflects an issue with the targeting mechanism in rural areas.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of food assistance estimate by sector\n\n\n\nThe results of the percentages of in-kind assistance in figure 3 reveal the same findings with that of cash and food assistance. Very poor households (5.88 per cent) received the most from in-kind assistance followed by poor households (1.01 per cent) in urban areas. Rich households (1.47 per cent) benefitted the most from in-kind assistance in rural areas followed by average households (1.40 per cent).\n\n\n\nRepresentation of in-kind assistance estimate by sector\n\n\n\nWe did not observe the same result for scholarships as the percentage estimate turned out to be quite different. Very poor households (0.00%) received nothing from scholarship in urban areas while very rich households (0.33 per cent) received the most from scholarship in rural areas. This might have resulted from scholarship not being targeted to indigent students but to exceptional students.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of scholarship estimate by sector\n\n\n\nWe also present regression tables of the different safety net measures showing the characteristics that can make households eligible to receive safety net measures in table 1 below. The table includes the interacted and non-interacted variables. The result from the regression estimate show that livestock household, dwelling of household, female-headed household and household head possessing an Advanced A’Level degree or higher significantly influence the chances of receiving cash assistance. This mean that being a livestock household raises the likelihood of receiving cash assistance compared to farming households; households dwelling in tents and uncompleted buildings are more likely to receive cash assistance than households in a comfortable apartment like bungalow and semi-detached house; and households headed by female are more likely to receive cash assistance compared to households headed by male. Also, elderly household has a significant positive effect on receiving cash assistance; however the effect was reduced when we interacted dwelling of households with elderly households.\nAs expected, we find that households with children less than 6 had a significant positive effect on receiving cash assistance. Interacting the gender of household with the educational level of the household head, we notice that the interaction had a negative significant effect on the possibility of receiving cash assistance. That is, using female-headed household as an example, the possibility of a female-headed household receiving cash assistance decreases as the level of education increases. From the regression estimate of cash assistance, we also find that interacting livestock household with the gender of the household head yields a negative significant effect on cash assistance. That is, being a livestock household, the chances of receiving cash assistance reduces given the gender of the household head. We also notice that households with school age children and asset score did not have any significant effect on receiving cash assistance\nTable 1: Regression estimates of cash assistance by characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\nVARIABLES\ncash assistance\ncash assistance\ncash assistance\ncash assistance\ncash assistance\ncash assistance\n\n\nRural household\n-0.000795\n(0.00275)\n-0.000770\n(0.00275)\n-0.000832\n(0.00275)\n-0.000933\n(0.00275)\n-0.000933\n(0.00275)\n-0.000983\n(0.00275)\n\n\nOwned a non-agricultural business\n0.00466\n(0.00294)\n0.00470\n(0.00294)\n0.00478\n(0.00294)\n0.00490*\n(0.00294)\n0.00490*\n(0.00294)\n0.00494*\n(0.00294)\n\n\nProcessed any purchased crops\n0.00278\n(0.00453)\n0.00272\n(0.00453)\n0.00278\n(0.00453)\n0.00281\n(0.00453)\n0.00281\n(0.00453)\n0.00290\n(0.00453)\n\n\nOwned a trading business\n0.00269\n(0.00248)\n0.00259\n(0.00248)\n0.00260\n(0.00248)\n0.00264\n(0.00248)\n0.00264\n(0.00248)\n0.00268\n(0.00248)\n\n\nIndividual in the household\n0.000573\n(0.000725)\n0.000559\n(0.000725)\n0.000536\n(0.000725)\n0.000493\n(0.000725)\n0.000493\n(0.000725)\n0.000481\n(0.000725)\n\n\nFarming household\n0.00312\n(0.00294)\n0.00309\n(0.00294)\n0.00317\n(0.00294)\n0.00318\n(0.00294)\n0.00318\n(0.00294)\n0.00314\n(0.00294)\n\n\nLivestock household\n0.00488**\n(0.00243)\n0.00498**\n(0.00243)\n0.00486**\n(0.00243)\n0.0223***\n(0.00243)\n0.0223***\n(0.00243)\n0.0222***\n(0.00243)\n\n\nDwelling of household\n0.00780***\n(0.00264)\n0.00779***\n(0.00264)\n0.00787***\n(0.00264)\n0.00787***\n(0.00264)\n0.00791***\n(0.00295)\n0.00100\n(0.00617)\n\n\nFemale-headed household\n0.00984***\n(0.00341)\n0.0237***\n(0.00795)\n0.0257***\n(0.00816)\n0.0314***\n(0.00853)\n0.0314***\n(0.00853)\n0.0314***\n(0.00853)\n\n\nEducation level of household head_2\n0.00912**\n(0.00377)\n0.0221***\n(0.00771)\n0.0246***\n(0.00804)\n0.0253***\n(0.00805)\n0.0253***\n(0.00805)\n0.0242***\n(0.00809)\n\n\nEducation level of household head _3\n0.00747*\n(0.00407)\n0.0323**\n(0.0135)\n0.0375***\n(0.0143)\n0.0389***\n(0.0143)\n0.0389***\n(0.0143)\n0.0365**\n(0.0144)\n\n\nAsset score\n5.03e-05\n(0.000467)\n6.31e-05\n(0.000467)\n-0.00144\n(0.00144)\n-0.000979\n(0.00145)\n-0.000979\n(0.00145)\n-0.000968\n(0.00145)\n\n\nElderly household\n0.00587**\n(0.00293)\n0.00580**\n(0.00293)\n0.00573*\n(0.00293)\n0.00575**\n(0.00293)\n0.00580*\n(0.00331)\n0.00577*\n(0.00331)\n\n\nHouseholds with children less than 6\n0.00289**\n(0.00112)\n0.00292***\n(0.00112)\n0.00290***\n(0.00112)\n0.00287**\n(0.00112)\n0.00287**\n(0.00112)\n0.00290***\n(0.00112)\n\n\nHouseholds with school-age children\n0.000256\n(0.00115)\n0.000266\n(0.00115)\n0.000287\n(0.00115)\n0.000296\n(0.00115)\n0.000296\n(0.00115)\n0.000310\n(0.00115)\n\n\nHouseholds with foster children\n5.97e-05\n(0.00506)\n-0.000514\n(0.00507)\n-0.000332\n(0.00507)\n0.000326\n(0.00508)\n0.000323\n(0.00508)\n0.000370\n(0.00508)\n\n\nHousehold head gender_Education level of household head\n\n-0.0115*\n(0.00593)\n-0.0137**\n(0.00628)\n-0.0143**\n(0.00628)\n-0.0143**\n(0.00628)\n-0.0143**\n(0.00628)\n\n\nAsset score_Household head gender\n\n\n0.00130\n(0.00118)\n0.000930\n(0.00120)\n0.000930\n(0.00120)\n0.000916\n(0.00120)\n\n\nLivestock household_ Household head gender\n\n\n\n-0.0154**\n(0.00675)\n-0.0154**\n(0.00675)\n-0.0153**\n(0.00675)\n\n\nDwelling of households_ Elderly household\n\n\n\n\n-0.000213\n(0.00660)\n7.05e-05\n(0.00660)\n\n\nEducation level of household head _Dwelling of households\n\n\n\n\n\n0.00532\n(0.00417)\n\n\nConstant\n0.00142\n(0.00334)\n0.0126*\n(0.00667)\n0.0149**\n(0.00701)\n0.0148**\n(0.00701)\n0.0148**\n(0.00701)\n0.0152**\n(0.00702)\n\n\nObservations\n16,610\n16,610\n16,610\n16,610\n16,610\n16,610\n\n\nR-squared\n0.004\n0.004\n0.004\n0.004\n0.004\n0.005\n\n\n\nMoving on to food subsidies, table 2 present the regression estimate of possible characteristics that can make households eligible to receive food subsidies. Unlike cash transfers, we see that there are a lot of characteristics that significantly affect whether households will receive food assistance or not. From the result, we see that rural households, households that processed any purchased crops, households that owned a trading business, households involved in agricultural activities (farming and livestock) and household head possessing an Advanced A’Level and above raises the chances of receiving food assistance. Also, the regression estimate of households with children less than 6 and school age children yields a positive significant effect on receiving food assistance. The positive significant effect for school age children can be traced to the establishment of school feeding programs.\nInteracting the regression estimate of asset score with children less than 6, we find a negative significant effect on receiving food assistance. That is, even though households with children are more likely to receive food assistance, the chances reduce as the asset score increases. Higher wealth index (represented by asset score) also reduces the likelihood of receiving assistance but this effect was weakened by the education level of the household head. We also notice that dwelling of household and households that are headed by female did not have significant effect on receiving food assistance.\nTable 2: Regression estimates of food assistance by characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\n\nVARIABLES\nfood_assistance\nfood_assistance\nfood_assistance\nfood_assistance\nfood_assistance\n\n\nRural household\n0.0210***\n(0.00607)\n0.0204***\n(0.00608)\n0.0201***\n(0.00608)\n0.0201***\n(0.00608)\n0.0202***\n(0.00608)\n\n\nOwned a nonagricultural business\n0.0118*\n(0.00650)\n0.0127*\n(0.00651)\n0.0128**\n(0.00651)\n0.0128**\n(0.00651)\n0.0128**\n(0.00651)\n\n\nProcessed any purchased crops\n0.0587***\n(0.0100)\n0.0587***\n(0.0100)\n0.0585***\n(0.0100)\n0.0562***\n(0.0103)\n0.0562***\n(0.0103)\n\n\nOwned a trading business\n0.0200***\n(0.00548)\n0.0206***\n(0.00549)\n0.0207***\n(0.00549)\n0.0208***\n(0.00549)\n0.0195***\n(0.00605)\n\n\nIndividual in the household\n0.00315*\n(0.00161)\n0.00322**\n(0.00161)\n0.00322**\n(0.00161)\n0.00324**\n(0.00161)\n0.00321**\n(0.00161)\n\n\nFarming household\n0.0211***\n(0.00651)\n0.0208***\n(0.00651)\n0.0216***\n(0.00652)\n0.0216***\n(0.00652)\n0.0216***\n(0.00652)\n\n\nLivestock household\n0.0178***\n(0.00537)\n0.0172***\n(0.00538)\n0.0169***\n(0.00538)\n0.0169***\n(0.00538)\n0.0169***\n(0.00538)\n\n\nDwelling of household\n-0.00303\n(0.00652)\n-0.00288\n(0.00652)\n-0.00279\n(0.00652)\n-0.00285\n(0.00652)\n-0.00278\n(0.00652)\n\n\nFemale-headed household\n0.00762\n(0.00754)\n0.00754\n(0.00754)\n0.00716\n(0.00754)\n0.00729\n(0.00754)\n0.00731\n(0.00754)\n\n\nEducation level of household head_2\n0.0230***\n(0.00833)\n0.0216***\n(0.00836)\n0.0218***\n(0.00836)\n0.0217***\n(0.00836)\n0.0217***\n(0.00836)\n\n\nEducation level of household head_3\n-0.0200**\n(0.00901)\n-0.0317***\n(0.0109)\n-0.0311***\n(0.0109)\n-0.0311***\n(0.0109)\n-0.0311***\n(0.0109)\n\n\nAsset score\n-0.00625***\n(0.00103)\n-0.00972***\n(0.00209)\n-0.00781***\n(0.00225)\n-0.00781***\n(0.00225)\n-0.00780***\n(0.00225)\n\n\nElderly household\n0.0109\n(0.00830)\n0.0109\n(0.00830)\n0.0106\n(0.00830)\n0.0107\n(0.00830)\n0.00894\n(0.00898)\n\n\nHouseholds with children less than 6\n0.0170***\n(0.00257)\n0.0168***\n(0.00257)\n0.0166***\n(0.00257)\n0.0166***\n(0.00257)\n0.0166***\n(0.00257)\n\n\nHouseholds with school-age children\n0.0358***\n(0.00255)\n0.0357***\n(0.00255)\n0.0356***\n(0.00255)\n0.0355***\n(0.00255)\n0.0356***\n(0.00255)\n\n\nHouseholds with foster children\n0.0270*\n(0.0143)\n0.0272*\n(0.0143)\n0.0279*\n(0.0143)\n0.0252*\n(0.0143)\n0.0252*\n(0.0143)\n\n\nDwelling of household_Elderly household\n-0.0153\n(0.0146)\n-0.0152\n(0.0146)\n-0.0152\n(0.0146)\n-0.0152\n(0.0146)\n-0.0155\n(0.0146)\n\n\nAsset score_Education level of household head\n\n0.00228*\n(0.00119)\n0.00212*\n(0.00120)\n0.00211*\n(0.00120)\n0.00211*\n(0.00120)\n\n\nAsset score_Children less than 6\n\n\n-0.00129**\n(0.000552)\n-0.00128**\n(0.000552)\n-0.00128**\n(0.000552)\n\n\nConstant\n-0.0243***\n(0.00753)\n-0.0237***\n(0.00754)\n-0.0240***\n(0.00754)\n-0.0240***\n(0.00754)\n-0.0237***\n(0.00756)\n\n\nObservations\n16,603\n16,603\n16,603\n16,603\n16,603\n\n\nR-squared\n0.101\n0.101\n0.101\n0.101\n0.101\n\n\n\nThe regression estimate for in-kind assistance is presented below in table 3.

    "text": "4.2 Question 2: How was the support utilized?\nThe uses of safety net measures may differ based on urban or rural area. In the safety net section of the NLSS questionnaire, households were asked: What type of assistance was received? The options include cash assistance, food assistance, in-kind assistance and scholarship. These are the safety net measures we’ve based our study on. Further, a follow-up question was asked: How did your household use the money received from programme? This question was meant for participants that selected cash assistance and scholarship in the first question. Also, the option for uses was given in the questionnaire as the 13 uses in the table below.\nIn table 5, we present the number of number of households that used cash assistance and scholarship for different uses and their respective percentages. We find that 38% of households used cash assistance for other household consumption. As expected, approximately 91% of households used the scholarship support given to them for education.\nTable 5: Tabulation of cash transfers and scholarships against their uses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses\nCash transfers\nScholarship\nPercentage of cash transfers\nPercentage of scholarship\n\n\nPurchased land\n1\n0\n0.1848429\n0\n\n\nPurchased agricultural inputs for food crops\n64\n1\n11.82994\n3.125\n\n\nPurchased inputs for cash crops\n17\n0\n3.142329\n0\n\n\nPurchased livestock\n16\n1\n2.957486\n3.125\n\n\nBusiness start-up capital\n31\n0\n5.730129\n0\n\n\nNon-farm business costs\n18\n0\n3.327172\n0\n\n\nCeremonies (Marriage, Burial, Other Social Functions Etc.)\n17\n0\n3.142329\n0\n\n\nEducation\n62\n29\n11.46026\n90.625\n\n\nMotor vehicle purchase\n2\n0\n0.3696858\n0\n\n\nHome purchase or construction\n19\n0\n3.512015\n0\n\n\nOther household consumption\n207\n1\n38.26248\n3.125\n\n\nHealth expenses\n77\n0\n14.2329\n0\n\n\nOther (Specify)\n10\n0\n1.848429\n0\n\n\n\nTo get a clearer understanding of uses by sector of cash assistance and scholarship, tabulations of the urban and rural areas were carried out. The result in table 6 show us that for both cash assistance and scholarship, rural households recorded a higher percentage (16.33 per cent and 7.69 per cent) of using the support for the purchase of agricultural inputs for food crops than urban households (10.71 per cent and 0.00 per cent). We find that in urban households, support given under scholarship was fully utilized for education (100.00 per cent), while in rural households, even though a higher proportion (84.62 per cent) was used for education purposes, it was also diverted for the purchase of agricultural inputs for food crops, purchase of livestock and for other household consumption with 7.69 per cent for the three uses. The support given under scholarship which was fully utilized for education (100.00%) in urban areas can be attributed to some factors. First, it is important to highlight that rural households are meant to benefit from scholarship than urban households. Study by Murgai and Zaidi (2005) suggests that a large share of the total resources devoted to these programs disappear before reaching their intended beneficiaries could be one of the factors. This was further strengthened by the work of Masud-All-Kamal and Saha (2014) who in their study examined the link between the targeting social policy and reduction in poverty. Their result revealed that other factors include administrative complexity, high cost, high leakages, mistargeting, weak governance, less transparency and accountability, political capture, and corruption in program implementation.\nTable 6: Rural and urban difference in the use of cash assistance and scholarship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUses\nRural and Urban Difference (in percentage)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash assistance\n\nScholarship\n\n\n\n\nUrban\nRural\nUrban\nRural\n\n\nPurchased land\n0.71\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nPurchased agricultural inputs for food crops\n10.71\n16.33\n0.00\n7.69\n\n\nPurchased inputs for cash crops\n0.71\n5.33\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nPurchased livestock\n1.43\n4.67\n0.00\n7.69\n\n\nBusiness start-up capital\n9.29\n6.00\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nNon-farm business costs\n7.86\n2.33\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nCeremonies (Marriage, Burial, Other Social Functions Etc.)\n2.86\n4.33\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nEducation\n17.86\n12.33\n100.00\n84.62\n\n\nMotor vehicle purchase\n0.71\n0.33\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nHome purchase or construction\n4.29\n4.33\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nOther household consumption\n41.43\n49.67\n0.00\n7.69\n\n\nHealth expenses\n19.29\n16.67\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nOther (Specify)\n1.43\n2.67\n0.00\n0.00"

    "text": "4.3 Question 3: Do transfers make a difference in household outcomes?\nThis question was answered using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) which pairs households that receive transfers with other similar households, We estimate the probability of receiving transfers as a function of individual and household characteristics, ranked recipient and non-recipient households by their propensity score, paired individual members of recipient households, and non-recipients with similar propensity scores, and calculate the average difference in consumption level across them. We estimate a logit model comprising the explanatory variables of receiving transfers. This was guided by data available in the survey, we selected characteristics that could make households receive safety net measures such as age of the household head (measured in years); household head gender, sector (rural/urban), household that owned a non-agricultural business, processed any purchased crops or livestock, whether household owned a trading business on the street, number of individual in a household, households involved in agricultural activities (farming and livestock), dwelling of households, education level of household head, asset score (from items owned by a household) , households with elderly people, households with children less than 6 (dependent children between 0-5 years), households with school age children (6-15), and households with foster children.\nLogit model estimates are employed to calculate the propensity score, which represents the likelihood of obtaining social grants. This estimate was then utilized to pair households that received safety net with those that did not receive them. After which balancing approach was used, the analysis of cash assistance, food assistance, in-kind assistance, and scholarship programs reveal a satisfactory balance through propensity-score matching, indicating that the observed outcomes align well with the expected distribution, validating the effectiveness of the matching approach in accounting for potential biases and ensuring a robust evaluation of the impact of these social welfare interventions."

    "text": "4.4 Impact of the different safety net measures on household outcomes\nThe effect of the transfers on consumption level is estimated below. The results of the propensity score matching are given in table 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. The results in table 7 show that cash assistance exerts a positive and significant impact on improving the consumption level of households in Nigeria. Specifically, the nearest neighbor matching NNM estimates of cash assistance show an increase in household consumption level by 570.76 in Nigeria. Our findings confirmed the conclusions of previous studies which have shown that cash transfers have positive impact on consumption level of households. The result also reveal that on average, the treated group has a slightly higher outcome (62,610) compared to the control group (62,039), indicating a positive impact of the intervention. However, the narrow difference of 570, combined with the high standard error, implies a considerable level of uncertainty in this estimate. The low T-statistic of 0.10 indicates that the observed difference is not statistically significant and could be attributed to random variability. In our exploration, we find a nuanced picture of the impact of cash transfers on non-food expenditures. While there is a slight observed increase in non-food expenditures for households that received cash transfers, this difference is not statistically significant. The marginal difference in consumption level between treated and control households raises questions about the effectiveness of cash transfers in influencing spending patterns within this context. Our findings underscore the importance of considering not only the average treatment effect but also the statistical significance of the observed differences.\nTable 7: Average treatment effect of cash assistance on consumption level of households\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSample\nTreated\nControls\nDifference\nS.E.\nT-stat\n\n\nConsumption level\nUnmatched\n62610.1141\n61033.1805\n1576.93354\n5529.09059\n0.29\n\n\n\nATT\n62610.1141\n62039.3536\n570.760456\n5784.84944\n0.10\n\n\n\nIn looking at the impact of food assistance, we used food consumption of households as the outcome. Households that received food subsidies demonstrated a significantly higher level of food consumption compared to those who did not receive these subsidies as seen in table 8. This observed increase of 149.29 in food consumption levels is not only statistically significant but also represents a tangible and meaningful improvement in the well-being of these households.\nThe data indicates that the food subsidies program is effectively fulfilling its intended purpose providing crucial support to households in enhancing their access to and consumption of nutritious food. This impact is particularly noteworthy considering the diverse characteristics of the households involved, including economic activities, dwelling types, and family structures. While our analysis captures the average treatment effect, it’s important to acknowledge the potential broader implications of increased food consumption. Improved nutrition, better health outcomes, and enhanced overall quality of life could be among the positive consequences of this food assistance.\nTable 8: Average treatment effect of food assistance on food consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSample\nTreated\nControls\nDifference\nS.E.\nT-stat\n\n\nfood_consumption\nUnmatched\n445.706888\n347.825583\n97.8813048\n28.8257488\n3.40\n\n\n\nATT\n445.706888\n296.414286\n149.292602\n39.112943\n3.82\n\n\n\nAlso, table 9 reveals the impact of in-kind assistance on consumption level of households. The result suggests that the causal effect of in-kind assistance on consumption level is about 50946 in Nigeria. This indicates a considerable positive effect of the treatment on the treated group, with an average outcome of 108,584.094 compared to 57,638 in the control group. The large difference of 50,945.614 is statistically significant, as evidenced by the T-statistic of 5.07, implying that this result is unlikely to have occurred by random chance. This suggests a robust and meaningful impact of the treatment on the variable being measured. Researchers can have confidence in asserting that the treatment has a substantial positive effect, as indicated by the significant difference and the low likelihood that the observed results are merely due to random fluctuations. This story supports the idea that the treatment, as reflected in the ATT, is associated with a considerable and statistically significant improvement in the outcome of interest in the treated group compared to the control group.\nTable 9: Average treatment effect of in-kind assistance on consumption level of households\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSample\nTreated\nControls\nDifference\nS.E.\nT-stat\n\n\nConsumption level\nUnmatched\n108584.094\n60394.3468\n48189.7468\n6816.95716\n7.07\n\n\n\nATT\n108584.094\n57638.4795\n50945.614\n10047.3512\n5.07\n\n\n\nIn table 10, we show the impact of scholarship on total education expenditure. We calculated the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) to gauge the difference in education expenditures between those households that received a scholarship and those that did not. In our analysis, we find a clear and statistically significant positive impact of scholarships on household education expenditures. Households that received scholarships demonstrated a substantially higher commitment to investing in education compared to those without scholarships. This difference is particularly meaningful, suggesting that scholarships play a vital role in enabling households to allocate more resources to education-related expenses.\nTable 10: Average treatment effect of scholarship on total expenditure on education of households\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSample\nTreated\nControls\nDifference\nS.E.\nT-stat\n\n\ntotaledu_expenditure\nUnmatched\n13000\n5746.42215\n7253.57785\n6848.68583\n1.06\n\n\n\nATT\n13000\n5155.76923\n7844.23077\n6080.95983\n1.29\n\n\n\nIn our quest to understand the nexus between scholarships and education, we also examined the impact of scholarship using school attendance as the outcome variable in table 11. From the result, there is a positive trend. Households that received scholarships exhibit a slightly higher likelihood of having a child currently attending school compared to those without scholarships. The modest increase of 0.6538 percentage points, although not statistically significant, hints at the potential positive influence of scholarships on school attendance.\nTable 11: Average treatment effect of scholarship on current school attendance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSample\nTreated\nControls\nDifference\nS.E.\nT-stat\n\n\ncurrent school attendance\nUnmatched\n9.21153846\n6.58449556\n2.6270429\n.524739548\n5.01\n\n\n\nATT\n9.21153846\n8.55769231\n.653846154\n.913593505\n0.72"
